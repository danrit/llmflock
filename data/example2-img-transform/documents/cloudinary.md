### Overview

The default Cloudinary asset delivery URL has the following structure:

https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud_name>/<asset_type>/<delivery_type>/<transformations>/<version>/<public_id_full_path>.<extension>

This reference covers the parameters and corresponding options and values that can be used in the `<transformations>` element of the URL. It also covers the [&lt;extension&gt;](#extension) element.

For information on other elements of the URL, see [Transformation URL syntax](image_transformations#transformation_url_syntax).

> Important
>
> The transformation names and syntax shown in this reference refer to the **URL API**.
>
>
> Depending on the Cloudinary SDK you use, the names and syntax for the same transformation may be different. Therefore, all of the transformation examples in this reference also include the code for generating the example delivery URL from your chosen SDK.
>
>
> The SDKs additionally provide a variety of helper methods to simplify the building of the transformation URL as well as other built-in capabilities. You can find more information about these in the relevant [SDK guides](cloudinary_sdks).

> Tip
> You can use the [Media Library](media_library_for_developers) to preview and manage your transformations:
>
> - [Quickly test transformations](media_library_for_developers#quick_delivery_testing) in the Media Library by opening the image URL and manually adding transformations before implementing them programmatically.
> - [Manage derived assets](media_library_for_developers#derived_assets) from the **Derived Assets** tab in an asset's Manage page.

##### Parameter types

There are two types of transformation parameters:

- **Action parameters**: Parameters that perform a specific transformation on the asset.
- **Qualifier parameters**: Parameters that do not perform an action on their own, but rather alter the default behavior or otherwise adjust the outcome of the corresponding action parameter.

See the *Transformation Guide* for additional guidelines and best practices regarding [parameter types](image_transformations#parameter_types).

### .&lt;extension&gt;


Although not a transformation parameter belonging to the `<transformation>` element of the URL, the extension of the URL can transform the format of the delivered asset, in the same way as [f_&lt;supported format&gt;](#supported-format).

If [f_&lt;supported format&gt;](#supported-format) or [f_&lt;auto&gt;](#auto-3) are not specified in the URL, the format is determined by the extension. If no format or extension is specified, then the asset is delivered in its originally uploaded format.

- If using an SDK to generate your URL, you can control the extension using the `format` parameter, or by adding the extension to the public ID.
- If using a raw transformation, for example to define an [eager](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations) or [named](named_transformations) transformation, you can specify the extension at the end of the transformation parameters, following a forward slash. For example, `c_pad,h_300,w_300/jpg` means that the delivery URL has transformation parameters of `c_pad,h_300,w_300` and a `.jpg` extension. `c_pad,h_300,w_300/` represents the same transformation parameters, but with no extension.

> Note
> As the extension is considered to be part of the transformation, be careful when defining [eager transformations](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations) and transformations that are allowed when [strict transformations](control_access_to_media#strict_transformations) are enabled, as the delivery URL must exactly match the transformation, including the extension.

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| extension | string | The format to use when delivering the asset.  **Possible values**: Any supported delivery format as relevant for the file type you are delivering:  - [Supported image formats](image_format_support#supported_image_formats) - [Supported video formats](video_transcoding#supported_video_formats) - [Supported audio formats](audio_transformations#supported_audio_formats)  **Default**: The originally uploaded format of the asset. |

##### Examples

1. Deliver the image as a JPEG by setting the extension (`.jpg`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sheep.jpg
  ```
2. Deliver the image as a PNG by using the SDK `format` parameter, which sets the extension of the URL. Note that in contrast to [f (fetch format)](#f-format), this isn't a *transformation* parameter, but rather an SDK parameter that controls the file extension of the public ID in the resulting URL.

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sheep.png
  ```
3. Deliver the image in its originally uploaded format (no extension specified):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sheep
  ```

### a (angle)


Rotates or flips an asset by the specified number of degrees or automatically according to its orientation or available metadata. Multiple modes can be applied by [concatenating their values with a dot](#dot_rotation).

**Learn more**: [Rotating images](effects_and_artistic_enhancements#rotating_images) | [Rotating videos](video_manipulation_and_delivery#rotating_videos)

#### &lt;degrees&gt;

 `a_<degrees>`
Rotates an asset by the specified angle.

**See also**: [Arithmetic expressions](user_defined_variables#arithmetic_expressions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| degrees | integer | The number of degrees to rotate the asset clockwise (positive value) or counter-clockwise (negative value). If the angle is not a multiple of 90, a rectangular bounding box is added containing the rotated asset. |

> Note
> If either the width or height of an asset exceeds 3000 pixels, the asset is automatically downscaled first, and then rotated. This applies to the size of the asset that is the input to the rotation, whether that be the output of a previous chained transformation or the original asset size.

##### Examples

1. Rotate an image by 90 degrees clockwise (`a_90`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/a_90/sheep.jpg
  ```
2. Rotate a video by 20 degrees counterclockwise (`a_-20`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/a_-20/docs/hotel-slow-motion-waterfall.mp4
  ```

#### &lt;mode&gt;

 `a_<mode>`
Rotates an image or video based on the specified mode.

**Use with:** To apply one of the `a_auto` modes, use it as a qualifier with a [cropping](#c-cropresize) action that adjusts the aspect ratio, as per the syntax details and example below.

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mode | constant | **Required.** The rotation mode to apply. **Possible values**:  - `vflip`: Vertically mirror flips the image or video. - `hflip`: Horizontally mirror flips the image or video. - `ignore`:  **Applicable to images only**. By default, the image is automatically rotated according to the EXIF data stored by the camera when the image was taken. Set the rotation to `ignore` if you do not want the image to be automatically rotated. - `auto_right`: **Applicable to images only**. If the requested aspect ratio of a crop does not match the image's original aspect ratio (landscape vs portrait ratio), rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise. Must be used as a [qualifier](#parameter-types) of a [cropping](#c-cropresize) action. - `auto_left`: **Applicable to images only**. If the requested aspect ratio of a crop does not match the image's original aspect ratio (it is greater than 1, while the original is less than 1, or vice versa), rotates the image 90 degrees counterclockwise. Must be used as a [qualifier](#parameter-types) of a [cropping](#c-cropresize) action. |

> Tip
> To apply multiple values, separate each value with a dot (`.`). For example to horizontally flip the image and rotate it by 45 degrees: `a_hflip.45`

##### Examples

1. Vertically mirror flip the image and then rotate it by another 20 degrees clockwise using the dot notation to apply more than one rotation option (`a_vflip`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/a_vflip.20/sheep.png
  ```
2. In the following example, the image is rotated counter-clockwise (`a_auto_left`) because the original image was a landscape (aspect ratio greater than 1), while the requested aspect ratio is portrait (aspect ratio = 0.7).
  If the requested aspect ratio had been 1.0 or larger, the same transformation would not result in rotation.

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_fill,w_300,ar_0.7,a_auto_left/sheep.jpg
  ```

### ac (audio codec)

 `ac_<codec value>`
Sets the audio codec.

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| codec value | constant | **Required.** The audio codec to use.  **Possible values**: - `none`: Removes the audio channel. - `aac`: Sets the audio codec to aac (mp4 only). - `vorbis`: Sets the audio codec to vorbis (ogv or webm only). - `mp3`: Sets the audio codec to mp3 (mp4 only). - `opus`: Sets the audio codec to opus (webm only). - `pcm24`: Sets the audio codec to PCM signed 24-bit little-endian. |

##### Examples

Remove the audio from a video (`ac_none`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/ac_none/docs/parrot.mp4
```

### af (audio frequency)

 `af_<frequency value>`
Caps the audio sampling frequency at the specified value. If the source audio uses a higher frequency, Cloudinary downsamples it to the specified value. If the source frequency is already at or below the specified value, Cloudinary retains the original frequency and doesn't raise it.

As a [qualifier](#parameter-types), can be used to preserve the original frequency, overriding the default frequency behavior of `vc_auto`.

**As a qualifier, use with**: [vc_auto](#auto-7)

**Learn more**: [Audio frequency control](audio_transformations#audio_frequency_control)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frequency value | string \| constant | The maximum output frequency in Hz. If the source audio uses a higher frequency, Cloudinary downsamples it to this value; if the source is already at or below this value, Cloudinary retains the original frequency. **Possible values**:  - A fixed value specific to the codec used:   - **aac**: `96000`, `88200`, `64000`, `48000`, `44100`, `32000`, `24000`, `22050`, `16000`, `12000`, `11025`, `8000`, `7350`   - **libfdk_aac**: `96000`, `88200`, `64000`, `48000`, `44100`, `32000`, `24000`, `22050`, `16000`, `12000`, `11025`, `8000`, `0`   - **mp3**: `44100`, `48000`, `32000`, `22050`, `24000`, `16000`, `11025`, `12000`, `8000`, `0`   - **opus**: `48000`, `24000`, `16000`, `12000`, `8000`, `0`   - **pcm**: `48000`, `96000`, `0`   `iaf`: Retains the original (initial) audio frequency of the video. This value is relevant when using [vc_auto](#vc-video-codec), where the audio frequency would otherwise automatically default to another value. |

##### Example

Cap the audio frequency at 96000 Hz (`af_96000`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/af_96000/docs/parrot.mp4
```

### ar (aspect ratio)

 `ar_<ratio value>`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that crops or resizes the asset to a new aspect ratio, for use with a crop/resize mode that determines how the asset is adjusted to the new dimensions.

**Use with**: [c (crop/resize)](#c-cropresize)

**Learn more**: [Setting the resize dimensions](resizing_and_cropping#setting_the_resize_dimensions)

**See also**: [h (height)](#h-height) | [w (width)](#w-width) | [Arithmetic expressions](user_defined_variables#arithmetic_expressions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ratio value | string \| float | **Required**. The aspect ratio to apply. Can be set as either: - A **string** value in the form `a:b`, where `a` is the width and `b` is the height (e.g., `16:9`). A **decimal** value representing the width divided by the height (e.g., `0.5`). |

##### Examples

1. Crop an image to an aspect ratio of 1.5 (`ar_1.5,c_crop`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/ar_1.5,c_crop/docs/camera-640.jpg
  ```
2. Fill a video to an aspect ratio of 1:1 (`ar_1:1,c_fill`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/ar_1:1,c_fill/ship.mp4
  ```

### b (background)


Applies a background to empty or transparent areas.

#### &lt;color value&gt;

 `b_<color value>`
Applies the specified background color on transparent background areas in an image.

Can also be used as a [qualifier](#parameter-types) to override the default background color for padded cropping of images and videos, text overlays and generated waveform images.

When using [chained transformations](image_transformations#chained_transformations), we recommend that you use this parameter as a qualifier to a pad crop that doesn't change the result (like `c_pad,w_1.0`), rather than by itself in a component. Using background by itself can lead to unpredictable results. For example:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/e_background_removal/b_lightblue,c_pad,w_1.0/e_trim/e_gen_restore/docs/cupcake.png
```

Rather than (background not applied):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/e_background_removal/b_lightblue/e_trim/e_gen_restore/docs/cupcake.png
```

**As a qualifier, use with**: [c_auto_pad - image only](#auto_pad) | [c_fill_pad - image only](#fill_pad) | [c_lpad](#lpad) | [c_mpad - image only](#mpad) | [c_pad](#pad) | [l_subtitles](#subtitles) | [l_text](#text) | [fl_waveform](#waveform)

**Learn more**: [Background color for images](effects_and_artistic_enhancements#setting_background_color) | [Background color for videos](video_effects_and_enhancements#background_color)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| color value | string | **Required.** The background color to apply. It can be set as: - A 3- or 4-digit RGB/RGBA hex - An RGB or RGBA hex triplet or quadruplet (6 or 8 digits) - A named color - `transparent` or `none` for no background. When specifying any RGB or RGBA value, always prefix the value in the URL with `rgb:` (without `#`). For example, `b_rgb:FEB61FC2` or `b_rgb:999`.  When using a named color, specify only the color name. For example `b_blue`. |

##### Examples

1. Convert the transparent background of the `car_white` image to a light-blue color (`b_lightblue`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/b_lightblue/car_white.png
  ```
2. Scale to fit an image into a 150 x 150 square and pad any excess space with a brown background (`b_brown`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_150,c_pad,b_brown/docs/camera-640.jpg
  ```
3. Apply 'chocolate' color padding to deliver the video in a 1:1 aspect ratio (`b_chocolate,c_pad,h_150,w_150`)

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/b_chocolate,c_pad,h_150,w_150/coffee_pour.mp4
  ```
4. Add a semi-transparent yellow background color to a text overlay (`b_rgb:FEB61FC2,co_yellow,l_text:Arial_100:Flowers/fl_layer_apply`)

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/b_rgb:FEB61FC2,co_yellow,l_text:Arial_100:Flowers/fl_layer_apply/flower.jpg
  ```

#### auto

 `b_auto[:<mode>][:<number>][:<direction>][:palette_<color 1>[_..._<color n>]]`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that automatically selects the background color based on one or more predominant colors in the image, for use with one of the padding crop mode transformations.

**Learn more**: [Content-aware padding](effects_and_artistic_enhancements#content_aware_padding)

**Use with**: [c_auto_pad - image only](#auto_pad) | [c_pad](#pad) | [c_lpad](#lpad) | [c_mpad](#mpad) | [c_fill_pad - image only](#fill_pad)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mode | constant | The method to use for determining the solid or gradient color(s) to apply.  **Possible values**: To automatically set the background to a single color: - `border`: Selects the predominant color, taking only the image border pixels into account. `predominant`: Selects the predominant color while taking all pixels in the image into account.`border_contrast`: Selects the strongest contrasting color to the predominant color, taking only the image border pixels into account.`predominant_contrast`: Selects the strongest contrasting color to the predominant color while taking all pixels in the image into account. To automatically apply a gradient fade to the background with multiple colors: - `predominant_gradient`: Bases the gradient fade effect on the predominant colors in the image.`predominant_gradient_contrast`: Bases the gradient fade effect on the colors that contrast the predominant colors in the image.`border_gradient`: Bases the gradient fade effect on the predominant colors in the border pixels of the image.`border_gradient_contrast`: Bases the gradient fade effect on the colors that contrast the predominant colors in the border pixels of the image. **Default:** `border`. |
| number | integer | Relevant only when setting `mode` to one of the 'gradient' options. The number of predominant colors to select. **Possible values**: `2`, `4`.**Default**: `2`. |
| direction | constant | Relevant only when setting `mode` to one of the 'gradient' options and when 2 colors are selected for the `number` option. Specifies the direction to blend the 2 colors together. (If 4 colors are selected, each gets interpolated between the four corners and this parameter is ignored.) **Possible values**: `horizontal`,  `vertical`, `diagonal_desc`, `diagonal_asc`. **Default**: `horizontal`. |
| color 1 to color n | string | The palette of colors to use in the border. For each color, specify either: - A 3- or 4-digit RGB/RGBA hex (e.g. f00) - An RGB or RGBA hex triplet or quadruplet (6 or 8 digits) (e.g. f2086a) - A named color (e.g. blue) |

##### Examples

1. Pad an image to a width and height of 150 pixels, and with the background color set to the predominant color from that image (`b_auto:predominant,c_pad,h_150,w_150`):

```

#### gen_fill

 `b_gen_fill[:prompt_<prompt>][;seed_<seed>]`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that automatically fills the padded area using generative AI to extend the image seamlessly. Optionally include a prompt to guide the image generation.

Using different seeds, you can regenerate the image if you're not happy with the result.  You can also use seeds to return a previously generated result, as long as any other preceding transformation parameters are the same.

> Notes and limitations:
>
> - Generative fill can only be used on non-transparent images.
> - There is a [special transformation count](transformation_counts#special_effect_calculations) for generative fill.
> - Generative fill isn't supported for [animated](animated_images) images or [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images.
> - If you get blurred results when using this feature, it is likely that the built-in NSFW (Not Safe For Work) check has detected something inappropriate. You can [contact support](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to disable this check if you believe it's too sensitive.
> - When Cloudinary is generating a derived version, you may get a 423 response returned until the version is ready. You can prepare derived versions in advance using an [eager transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations).
> - When Cloudinary is generating an [incoming transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations), you may get a 420 response returned, with status `pending` until the asset is ready.

**Learn more**: [Generative fill](generative_ai_transformations#generative_fill)

**Use with**: [c_auto_pad](#auto_pad) | [c_pad](#pad) | [c_lpad](#lpad) | [c_mpad](#mpad) | [c_fill_pad](#fill_pad)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prompt | string | A natural language description of what you want to include in the padding. |
| seed | integer | Any number that can be used either to regenerate a result, or to return a previously generated result. |

##### Examples

1. Seamlessly extend the width of an image to an aspect ratio of 16:9, with a width of 1250 pixels: (`ar_16:9,b_gen_fill,c_pad,w_1250`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/ar_16:9,b_gen_fill,c_pad,w_1250/docs/moped.jpg
  ```
2. Seamlessly extend both dimensions of an image using minimum pad to a width and height of 1100 pixels (`b_gen_fill,c_mpad,h_1100,w_1100`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/b_gen_fill,c_mpad,h_1100,w_1100/docs/gaudi.jpg

  ```

### bl (baseline)

 `bl_<named transformation>`
Establishes a baseline transformation from a [named transformation](named_transformations). The baseline transformation is cached, so when re-used with other transformation parameters, the baseline part of the transformation does not have to be regenerated, saving processing time and cost.

This is especially useful for transformations with [special transformation counts](transformation_counts#special_transformation_counts).

Also consider [eagerly](eager_and_incoming_transformations) generating a baseline transformation for transformations that take a long time to process. You can do that on upload, using the [upload method](image_upload_api_reference#upload) or an [upload preset](upload_presets), or for existing assets using the [explicit method](image_upload_api_reference#explicit).

> Notes
>
> - You can combine the baseline transformation with other transformation parameters, but it must be the **first component** in the chain and the **only transformation parameter** in that component.
> - You must specify a [supported format transformation](transformation_reference#f_supported_format) (`f_`) in the named transformation.
> - Consider using `f_jxl/q_100` in the baseline transformation to prevent images suffering from loss due to double lossy encoding.
> - You cannot use automatic format (`f_auto`) in the named transformation, although this can be used in a subsequent component.
> - If the named transformation contains [variables](user_defined_variables), the variables must be defined within the named transformation.
> - The baseline transformation is not supported for [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) media or [incoming transformations](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations).

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| named transformation | string | **Required**. The named transformation to use as the baseline transformation. |

##### Examples

1. Use a baseline transformation (`bl_bg-rem-gray-jxl`) to remove the background of an image, and apply the grayscale effect, formatted as a JXL with no loss of quality (the named transformation, `bg-rem-gray-jxl` has the underlying transformation, `e_background_removal/f_jxl/q_100/e_grayscale`). Then, apply a cartoonify effect and automatic format and quality (`e_cartoonify/f_auto/q_auto`) :

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/bl_bg-rem-gray-jxl/e_cartoonify/f_auto/q_auto/cld-sample.jpg
  ```
2. Use the same baseline transformation, but resize the image, then add an underlay of the sky at the same size (`bl_bg-rem-gray-jxl/c_fill,h_150/u_docs:sky/c_fill,h_150/fl_layer_apply`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/bl_bg-rem-gray-jxl/c_fill,h_150/u_docs:sky/c_fill,h_150/fl_layer_apply/f_auto/q_auto/cld-sample.jpg
  ```
3. Use a baseline transformation (`bl_first5-rotate`) to trim a video to the first five seconds, and rotate it 15 degrees, formatted as an MP4 (the named transformation, `first5-rotate` has the underlying transformation, `du_5/f_mp4/a_15`). Then, loop the video twice and let Cloudinary determine the best format and quality (`e_loop:2/f_auto/q_auto`) for delivery:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/bl_first5-rotate/e_loop:2/f_auto/q_auto/samples/cld-sample-video.mp4
  ```

### bo (border)

 `bo_<width>_<style>_<color>`
Adds a solid border around an image or video.

As a [qualifier](#parameter-types), adds a border to an overlay and ensures the border follows any rounded corners applied with the `r` (round corners) parameter.

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_fetch](#fetch) | [l_subtitles](#subtitles) | [l_text](#text) | [l_video](#video) | [u_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id-1) | [u_fetch](#fetch-1) | [r (round corners)](#r-round-corners)

### br (bitrate)


Controls the bitrate for audio or video files in bits per second. Includes the option to use either variable bitrate (default), with the bitrate value indicating the maximum bitrate, or constant bitrate. If specifying just a bitrate value, the same bitrate is used for both video and audio (if both are present). To control each separately, use [br_av](#av).

Supported for video codecs: `h264`, `h265 (MPEG-4)`; `vp8`, `vp9 (WebM)`

Supported for audio codecs: `aac`, `mp3`, `vorbis`

**Learn more**: [Bitrate control](video_optimization#bitrate_control)

#### &lt;bitrate value&gt;

  ```

### c (crop/resize)


Changes the size of the delivered asset according to the requested width & height dimensions.

Depending on the selected `<crop mode>`, parts of the original asset may be cropped out and/or the asset may be resized (scaled up or down).

When using any of the modes that can potentially crop parts of the asset, the selected [gravity](#g-gravity) parameter controls which part of the original asset is kept in the resulting delivered file.

**Learn more**: [Resizing and cropping images](resizing_and_cropping) | [Resizing and cropping videos](video_resizing_and_cropping)

#### auto

 `c_auto`
Automatically determines the best crop based on the gravity and specified dimensions.

If the requested dimensions are smaller than the best crop, the result is downscaled. If the requested dimensions are larger than the original image, the result is upscaled. Use this mode in conjunction with the [g (gravity)](#g-gravity) parameter.

##### Required qualifiers

[g (gravity)](#g-gravity)

And

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

(In rare cases, you may choose to [provide only one sizing qualifier](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier))

**Learn more**: [Automatic gravity with the automatic cropping mode](image_automatic_gravity#automatic_gravity_with_the_auto_cropping_mode)

##### Example

Create a 16:9 aspect ratio crop of an image of two smiling ladies, automatically deciding which parts of the image to keep (`c_auto,g_auto,ar_16:9,h_150`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_auto,g_auto,ar_16:9,h_150/docs/ladies-smiling.jpg
```

#### auto_pad

 `c_auto_pad`
Tries to prevent a "bad crop" by first attempting to use the `auto` cropping mode, but adding some padding if the algorithm determines that more of the original image needs to be included in the final image. Especially useful if the aspect ratio of the delivered asset is considerably different from the original's aspect ratio. Supported only in conjunction with [g_auto](#auto-4).

> Note
> Not supported for [animated images](animated_images).

##### Required qualifiers

[g_auto](#auto-4)

And

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

(In rare cases, you may choose to [provide only one sizing qualifier](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier))

##### Optional qualifiers

[b (background)](#b-background)

##### Example

Deliver an image as a 300 x 160 image using the `auto_pad` mode. (`b_auto,c_auto_pad,g_auto,h_160,w_300`).

Compare this to the same image delivered using the regular `auto` cropping mode (shown below on the right).

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/b_auto,c_auto_pad,g_auto,h_160,w_300/docs/men-laughing.jpg
```

**auto_pad**

**auto**

#### crop

 `c_crop`
Extracts the specified size from the original image without distorting or scaling the delivered asset.

By default, the center of the image is kept (extracted) and the top/bottom and/or side edges are evenly cropped to achieve the requested dimensions. You can specify the [gravity](#g-gravity) qualifier to control which part of the image to keep, either as a [compass direction](#compass-position) (such as `south` or `north_east`), one of the [special gravity positions](#special-position) (such as `faces` or `ocr_text`), [AI-based automatic region detection](#auto-4) or [AI-based object detection](#object).

You can also specify a specific region of the original image to keep by specifying [x and y qualifiers](#x-y-x-y-coordinates) together with [w (width)](#w-width) and [h (height)](#h-height) qualifiers to define an exact bounding box. When using this method, and no gravity is specified, the `x` and `y` coordinates are relative to the top-left (north-west) corner of the original asset. You can also use percentage based numbers instead of the exact coordinates for `x`, `y`, `w` and `h` (e.g., 0.5 for 50%). Use this method only when you already have the required absolute cropping coordinates. For example, you might use this if your application allows a user to upload [user-generated content](user_generated_content), and your application allows the user to manually select a region to crop from the original image, and you pass those coordinates to build the crop URL.

##### Required qualifiers

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

(In rare cases, you may choose to [provide only one sizing qualifier](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier))

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_south,h_150,w_200/docs/flower_shop.jpg
```

#### fill

 `c_fill`
Creates an asset with the exact specified width and height without distorting the asset. This option first scales as much as needed to at least fill both of the specified dimensions. If the requested aspect ratio is different than the original, cropping will occur on the dimension that exceeds the requested size after scaling. You can specify which part of the original asset you want to keep if cropping occurs using the [gravity](#g-gravity) (set to 'center' by default).

##### Required qualifiers

At least one of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

  ```

#### fill_pad

 `c_fill_pad`
Tries to prevent a "bad crop" by first attempting to use the `fill` mode, but adding some padding if the algorithm determines that more of the original image needs to be included in the final image, or if more content in specific frames in a video should be shown. Especially useful if the aspect ratio of the delivered asset is considerably different from the original's aspect ratio. Supported only in conjunction with [g_auto](#auto-4).

> Note
> Not supported for [animated images](animated_images).

##### Required qualifiers

```

#### lfill

 `c_lfill`
The `lfill` (limit fill) mode is the same as [fill](#fill) but only if the original image is larger than the specified resolution limits, in which case the image is scaled down to fill the specified width and height without distorting the image, and then the dimension that exceeds the request is cropped. If the original dimensions are smaller than the requested size, it is not resized at all. This prevents upscaling. You can specify which part of the original image you want to keep if cropping occurs using the [gravity](#g-gravity) parameter (set to `center` by default).

##### Required qualifiers

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

(In rare cases, you may choose to [provide only one sizing qualifier](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier))

##### Optional qualifiers

[g (gravity)](#g-gravity)

```

#### limit

 `c_limit`
Same as the [fit](#fit) mode but only if the original asset is larger than the specified limit (width and height), in which case the asset is scaled down so that it takes up as much space as possible within a bounding box defined by the specified width and height parameters. The original aspect ratio is retained (by default) and all of the original asset is visible. This mode doesn't scale up the asset if your requested dimensions are larger than the original image size.

##### Required qualifiers

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

(In rare cases, you may choose to [provide only one sizing qualifier](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier))

##### Example

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_limit,h_150,w_150/docs/camera-640.jpg
```

#### lpad

 `c_lpad`
The `lpad` (limit pad) mode is the same as [pad](#pad) but only if the original asset is larger than the specified limit (width and height), in which case the asset is scaled down to fill the specified width and height while retaining the original aspect ratio (by default) and with all of the original asset visible. This mode doesn't scale up the asset if your requested dimensions are bigger than the original asset size. Instead, if the proportions of the original asset do not match the requested width and height, padding is added to the asset to reach the required size. You can also specify where the original asset is placed by using the [gravity](#g-gravity) parameter (set to `center` by default). Additionally, you can specify the color of the [background](#b-background) in the case that padding is added. See [padding notes](#padding_notes) for guidance on one-qualifier behavior and width-only padding.

You can use the `lpad` resize mode as a way of applying padding to all sides of an asset, like a border, or frame.

##### Required qualifiers

Two of the following:  [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

##### Optional qualifiers

[g_&lt;gravity position&gt;](#compass-position) | [b (background)](#b-background)

##### Examples

1. Limit-pad an image with a green background to a width of 400 pixels and a height of 150 pixels (`b_green,c_lpad,h_150,w_400`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/b_green,c_lpad,h_150,w_400/docs/camera-640.jpg
  ```
2. Apply padding to all sides of a video by specifying a bounding box that's square, and has a width of 1.1 times the original width (`ar_1.0,b_green,c_lpad,w_1.1`):

#### mfit

 `c_mfit`
The `mfit` (minimum fit) mode is the same as [fit](#fit) but only if the original image is smaller than the specified minimum (width and height), in which case the image is scaled up so that it takes up as much space as possible within a bounding box defined by the specified width and height parameters. The original aspect ratio is retained (by default) and all of the original image is visible. This mode doesn't scale down the image if your requested dimensions are smaller than the original image's.

##### Required qualifiers

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

(In rare cases, you may choose to [provide only one sizing qualifier](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier))

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_mfit,h_20,w_20/docs/camera-640.jpg
```

#### mpad

 `c_mpad`
The `mpad` (minimum pad) mode applies padding to fill the whole area specified by the dimensions if those dimensions are larger than the original image's dimensions. This mode doesn't scale down the image if the requested dimensions are smaller than the original image's. In that case, the original image is delivered. You can also specify where the original image is placed by using the [gravity](#g-gravity) parameter (set to `center` by default). Additionally, you can specify the color of the [background](#b-background) in the case that padding is added. See [padding notes](#padding_notes) for guidance on one-qualifier behavior and width-only padding.

You can use the `mpad` resize mode as a way of applying padding to all sides of an image, like a border, or frame.

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/b_green,c_mpad,h_150,w_150/docs/camera-100.jpg
  ```

#### pad

 `c_pad`
Resizes the asset to fill the specified width and height while retaining the original aspect ratio (by default) and with all of the original asset visible. If the proportions of the original asset do not match the specified width and height, padding is added to the asset to reach the required size. You can also specify where the original asset is placed using the [gravity](#g-gravity) parameter (set to `center` by default). Additionally, you can specify the color of the [background](#b-background) in the case that padding is added.

If you're looking to apply padding to all sides of an asset, consider using [c_lpad](#lpad) or [c_mpad](#mpad).

##### Required qualifiers

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

<a id="padding_notes"></a>

> Padding notes
>
> - **Two sizing qualifiers recommended for pad resizing:** `c_pad` (as well as `c_lpad`, and `c_mpad`) work best when you provide two of `w`, `h`, or `ar`. If you provide only one (for example, just `w`), Cloudinary derives the other dimension from the original aspect ratio. Depending on the requested canvas, this can result in padding on both axes.
> - **Width-only (horizontal) padding:** If you want to add padding only to the width (not height):
>
>
>   - **Preferred:** Specify both `w` and `h` (for example, set `h` equal to the original height or to the desired canvas height), e.g.:
>     `.../image/upload/c_lpad,h_300,w_450/...jpg`
>   - **Alternative:** Add the `fl_ignore_aspect_ratio` flag to change only one dimension, then pad. For example:
>     `.../image/upload/c_lpad,fl_ignore_aspect_ratio,w_450/...jpg`
>     This keeps the original height while setting the width to 450, so padding is added horizontally only. (See also: [fl_ignore_aspect_ratio](#ignore_aspect_ratio)).
> - **Avoiding scale-down:** If you want to preserve the original size and still add padding to a requested canvas, use `c_mpad` (minimum pad). For example:
>   `.../image/upload/c_mpad,h_120,w_160/...jpg`
>   When the original is larger than the requested size, `c_mpad` delivers the original and adds padding as needed.

##### Example

Pad an image with a black background to a width and height of 150 pixels (`b_black,c_pad,h_150,w_150`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/b_black,c_pad,h_150,w_150/docs/camera-640.jpg
```

#### scale

 `c_scale`
Resizes the asset exactly to the specified width and height. All original asset parts are visible, but might be stretched or squashed if the dimensions you request have a different aspect ratio than the original.

If [only width or only height](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier) is specified, then the asset is scaled to the new dimension while retaining the original aspect ratio (unless you also include the [fl_ignore_aspect_ratio](#ignore_aspect_ratio) flag).

##### Required qualifiers

At least one of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

##### Optional qualifiers

[fl_ignore_aspect_ratio](#ignore_aspect_ratio) | [g_liquid](#special-position)

**See also**: [Liquid rescaling](image_gravity#liquid_rescaling)

##### Examples

1. Scale to a width of 150 pixels (maintains the aspect ratio by default) (`c_scale,w_150`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_150/docs/camera-640.jpg
  ```
2. Scale to a width and height of 150 pixels (does not maintain the aspect ratio) (`c_scale,h_150,w_150`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,h_150,w_150/docs/camera-640.jpg
  ```

#### thumb

 `c_thumb`
Creates image thumbnails based on a gravity position. Must always be accompanied by the [g (gravity)](#g-gravity) parameter. This cropping mode generates a thumbnail of an image with the exact specified width and height dimensions and with the original proportions retained, but the resulting image might be scaled to fit in the specified dimensions. You can specify the [z (zoom)](#z-zoom) parameter to determine how much to scale the resulting image within the specified width and height.

##### Required qualifiers

[g (gravity)](#g-gravity)

And

Two of the following: [w (width)](#w-width) | [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio)

(In rare cases, you may choose to [provide only one sizing qualifier](resizing_and_cropping#one_resize_qualifier))

##### Optional qualifiers

[z (zoom)](#z-zoom)

##### Example

Crop an image to a 150x150 thumbnail using face detection (`c_thumb,g_face,h_150,w_150`):

**Use with**: [e_colorize](#colorize) | [e_outline](#outline) | [e_make_transparent](#make_transparent) | [e_shadow](#shadow) | [l_text](#text) | [l_subtitles](#subtitles) | [fl_waveform](#waveform)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| color value | string | **Required.** The color to apply. It can be set as: - A 3- or 4-digit RGB/RGBA hex An RGB or RGBA hex triplet or quadruplet (6 or 8 digits). A named color When specifying any RGB or RGBA value, always prefix the value in the URL with `rgb:` (without `#`). For example, `co_rgb:FEB61FC2` or `co_rgb:999`.  When using a named color, specify only the color name. For example `co_blue`. |

##### Examples

1. Apply a colorize effect to an image, using an RGB hex triplet to define the green color for the colorize effect (`co_rgb:20a020,e_colorize:50`).

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/co_rgb:20a020,e_colorize:50/face_top.jpg
  ```
2. Outline a transparent shape, using 'orange' as the outline color (`co_orange,e_outline`).

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/co_orange,e_outline/ring2.png
  ```

### cs (color space)

 `cs_<color space mode>`
Controls the color space (RGB, sRGB, CMYK, custom ICC, etc) used for the delivered image or video.
If you don't include this parameter in your transformation, the color space of the original asset is generally retained. In some cases for videos, the color space is normalized for web delivery, unless `cs_copy` is specified.

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| color space mode | constant | **Required.** The color space mode to use when delivering the image or video. **Possible values**: - `sRGB`: Renders the image or video in the sRGB color space. - `tinysrgb`: Renders the image or video using Facebook's truncated sRGB color space. - `cmyk`: Renders the image or video in the CMYK color space. - `no_cmyk`: If the original image or video used the CMYK color space, converts it to sRGB. - `keep_cmyk`: Retains the CMYK color space when generating derived images or videos. - `srgb:truecolor`: **Image only**. Encodes the image as RGB, rather than palette or grayscale. Not applicable when using [q_auto](#auto-5). - `cs_icc:[public_id]`: **Image only**. Renders the image using the specified color space (ICC) file. You must upload the **.icc** file as a [raw](upload_parameters#uploading_non_media_files_as_raw_files) and [authenticated](upload_parameters#authenticated_assets) file. Specify the public ID of your ICC file including the file extension. - `copy`: **Video only**. Retains the original color space of the video. This prevents the color space from being normalized when the video is re-encoded by Cloudinary if another transformation is applied. |

##### Examples

1. Render an image in the sRGB color space (`cs_srgb`).

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/cs_srgb/face_top.jpg
  ```
2. Apply CMYK color space (`cs_cmyk`).

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/cs_cmyk/face_top.jpg
  ```

### d (default image)

 `d_<image asset>`
Specifies a backup placeholder image to be delivered in the case that the actual requested delivery image or social media picture does not exist. Any requested transformations are applied on the placeholder image as well.

> Notes
>
> - If the requested image does not exist and the default placeholder image is delivered instead, the `x_cld_error` header will also be included in the response.
> - The default placeholder image must be of [type](image_trans_flags_delivery_types#delivery_types) `upload`, i.e. publicly available.
> - When a default placeholder image is served (because the requested asset doesn't exist), Cloudinary typically responds with shorter-lived, `private` caching so browsers and caches pick up promptly when the originally requested asset becomes available. However, this stricter caching doesn't apply when `d_` is defined inside a [named transformation](named_transformations). [Learn more](named_transformations#default_image_placeholder_caching).

**Learn more**: [Using a default image placeholder](advanced_url_delivery_options#using_a_default_image_placeholder)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| image asset | string | **Required.** The public ID of the placeholder image plus the file extension. Replace any forward slashes with colons. |

##### Example

Return the image with public ID `docs/placeholders/samples/avatar` as a PNG if the requested image in the URL `non_existing_id` does not exist (`d_docs:placeholders:samples:avatar.png`).

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/d_docs:placeholders:samples:avatar.png/non_existing_id.png
```

### dl (delay)

 `dl_<time value>`
Controls the time delay between the frames of a delivered animated image. (The source asset can be an image or a video.)

**Related flag**: [fl_animated](#animated)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time | integer | **Required.** The delay in milliseconds between frames. |

##### Example

Convert a video to an animated image, and apply a delay of 200 milliseconds between frames (`dl_200`).

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/dl_200/surfers.gif
```

### dn (density)

 `dn_<dots per inch>`
Controls the density to use when delivering an image or when converting a vector file such as a PDF or EPS document to a web image delivery format.

- **For web image formats**: By default, if an image does not contain resolution information in its embedded metadata, Cloudinary normalizes any derived images for web optimization purposes and delivers them at 150 DPI. Controlling the DPI can be useful when generating a derived image intended for printing.


  > Tip
  > You can take advantage of the **idn** (initial density) value to automatically set the density of your image to the (pre-normalized) initial density of the original image (for example, `dn_idn`). This value is taken from the original image's metadata.
- **For vector files (PDF, EPS, etc.)**: When you deliver a vector file in a web image format, it is delivered by default at 150 DPI.

> Note
> When [automatic quality](image_optimization#automatic_quality_selection_q_auto) (`q_auto` in URLs) is applied to the delivered image, either due to the [default image quality](image_optimization#default_image_quality) setting or as a URL transformation parameter, the DPI and resolution metadata are effectively stripped (the fields exist but you shouldn't rely on the values). This is true even if you set the `dn` parameter. To prevent this behavior, provide a quality value in the delivery URL, such as `q_80`.

**See also**: [Arithmetic expressions](user_defined_variables#arithmetic_expressions)

**Learn more**: [Deliver a PDF page as an image](paged_and_layered_media#deliver_a_selected_pdf_page_as_an_image)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dots per inch | integer | **Required.** The DPI of the delivered image. |

##### Example

Deliver a JPEG image of the first page of the PDF file with a density of 20 (`dn_20`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/dn_20/multi_page_pdf.jpg
```

### dpr (DPR)


Sets the device pixel ratio (DPR) for the delivered image or video using a specified value or automatically based on the requesting device.

#### &lt;pixel ratio&gt;

 `dpr_<pixel ratio>`
Delivers the image or video in the specified device pixel ratio.

> Note
> When setting a DPR value, you must also include a [crop/resize transformation](transformation_reference#c_crop_resize) specifying a certain width or height.

> Important
> When delivering at a DPR value larger than `1`, ensure that you also set the desired final display dimensions in your image or video tag. For example, if you set `c_scale,h_300/dpr_2.0` in your delivery URL, you should also set `height=300` in your image tag. Otherwise, the image will be delivered at 2.0 x the requested dimensions (a height of 600px in this example).

**Learn more**: [Set Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)](image_upscaling_and_downscaling#set_device_pixel_ratio_dpr)

**See also**: [Arithmetic expressions](user_defined_variables#arithmetic_expressions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pixel ratio | float | **Required.** A positive value for the device pixel ratio to use when delivering the image or video. |

##### Example

Deliver the image with a dpr of 2.0 (`dpr_2.0`).

> Note
> While the code example below shows only the transformation URL, the image tag for the displayed inline image includes a hard-coded **height** definition in the image tag, to ensure that the doubled-DPR is still delivered within a display of 150px. If you view just the transformed `dpr_2.0` URL outside the image tag, it displays with a height of 300px.

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,h_150/dpr_2.0/face_top.jpg
```

#### auto

 `dpr_auto`
Delivers the image in a resolution that automatically matches the DPR (Device Pixel Ratio) setting of the requesting device, rounded up to the nearest integer. Only works for certain browsers and when **Client-Hints** are enabled.

**Learn more**: [Automatic DPR](responsive_server_side_client_hints#automatic_pixel_density_detection)

##### Example

Deliver the image with a DPR automatically set (`dpr_auto`).

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,h_150/dpr_auto/face_top.jpg
```

> Tip
> **Using dpr_auto with native mobile apps**
> If you prefer to specify an explicit DPR value for your native mobile app, then instead of using `dpr_auto`, retrieve the device’s display scale and include it in the `dpr` transformation parameter.
>
>
> For example:
>
>
>
> You can also continue to use `dpr_auto` for automatic detection in browser contexts.

### dr (dynamic range)


Sets the dynamic range for video output, controlling whether the video is delivered in HDR (High Dynamic Range) or SDR (Standard Dynamic Range).

**Learn more**: [HDR video transformations](video_transcoding#hdr_video_transformations)

#### high

 `dr_high`
Requests HDR10 (High Dynamic Range) output for the video. When combined with `vc_h265`, Cloudinary performs direct transcoding while preserving the HDR10 color-grading and metadata from the source video.

**Learn more**: [HDR video transformations](video_transcoding#hdr_video_transformations)

> Notes
>
> - HDR video encoding uses the HEVC video codec in Main10 profile with 10-bit pixels. You must use `dr_high` together with `vc_h265` to request HDR output.
> - Cloudinary performs direct transcoding, preserving color-grading and HDR metadata. Conversions between different HDR formats (e.g., HDR10 to Dolby Vision) aren't supported.
> - If the source video can't be delivered as HDR (e.g., missing metadata, incorrect format, non-HLG/HDR10 compliant), Cloudinary automatically falls back to SDR output with no additional charge.

##### Examples

1. Request HDR output with HEVC codec (`dr_high,vc_h265`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/dr_high,vc_h265/docs/hdr_turtle.mp4

### du (duration)

 `du_<time value>`
Sets the duration (in seconds) of a video or audio clip.

- Can be used independently to **trim** a video or audio clip to the specified length. This parameter is often used in conjunction with the [so (start offset)](#so-start-offset) and/or [eo (end offset)](#eo-end-offset) parameters.
- Can be used as a [qualifier](#parameter-types) to control the length of time for a corresponding transformation.

**As a qualifier, use with**: [e_boomerang](#boomerang) | [l_audio](#audio) | [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_video](#video)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |

  ```
2. Deliver a video with a duration of 30% (`du_30p`) and a start offset of 6 seconds  into the video (`so_6`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/du_30p,so_6/paradise_location.mp4
  ```

### e (effect)


Applies the specified effect to an asset.

> Note
>
> If you specify more than one effect in a transformation component (separated by commas), only the last effect in that component is applied.
>
>
> To combine effects, use separate components (separated by forward slashes) following best practice guidelines, which recommend including only one [action parameter](image_transformations#parameter_types) per component.

#### background_removal

 `e_background_removal[:fineedges_<enable fine edges>]`
Makes the background of an image transparent.

> Notes and tips
>
> **Notes:**
>
>
> - There is a [special transformation count](transformation_counts#special_effect_calculations) for the background removal effect.
> - When Cloudinary is generating a derived version, you may get a 423 response returned until the version is ready. You can prepare derived versions in advance using an [eager transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations).
> - When Cloudinary is generating an [incoming transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations), you may get a 420 response returned, with status `pending` until the asset is ready.
> - The background removal transformation imposes a limit of 6144 x 6144 pixels on its input images. If an image exceeds this limit, the transformation first scales down the image to fit the limit, and then processes it. The scaling doesn't affect the aspect ratio of the image, but it does alter its output dimensions.
> - Background removal on the fly isn't supported for [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images.
>
>
> **Tips:**
>
>
> - This transformation generally gives better results than the [e_bgremoval](#bgremoval) and [e_make_transparent](#make_transparent) effects.
> - It works well for foreground objects with fine edges and lets you specify certain items that you expect to see as foreground objects.

> Notes
>
> - Either:
>
>
>   - the original image must include transparency, for example where the background has already been removed  and it has been stored in a format that supports transparency, such as PNG, or
>   - the `dropshadow` effect must be chained after the [background_removal](transformation_reference#e_background_removal) effect, for example:
>
>
>
> ```
> https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/e_background_removal/e_dropshadow/docs/lipstick
> ```
>
>
> - The dropshadow effect is not supported for [animated](animated_images) images, [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images or [incoming transformations](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations).

**Learn more**: [Dropshadow effect](effects_and_artistic_enhancements#dropshadow_effect)

**See also**: [e_shadow](#shadow)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| azimuth | integer | The direction the light is coming from to cause the shadow effect. A value of 0 / 360 (north) means that the light is coming from behind the object and the shadow will be dropped towards the front of the object.  **Range**: `0 to 360`. **Default**: `215`. |

```

#### embed_clipping_path

 `e_embed_clipping_path:mask_$<variable>`
Converts a mask image, referenced via a [user-defined variable](user_defined_variables#image_buffer_references), into a clipping path and embeds it into the output image metadata.

The mask variable must resolve to an image buffer. The effect is intended for formats that preserve clipping-path metadata in the delivered file, in particular JPEG and TIFF.

**Learn more**: [Embed a clipping path in image metadata](paged_and_layered_media#embed_a_clipping_path_in_image_metadata)

**See also**: [g_clipping_path](#clipping_path) | [fl_clip](#clip)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variable | string | **Required.** A user-defined variable that resolves to an image buffer. The image is converted into a clipping path, which is then embedded into the output image metadata. |

##### Example

Set variable `$mask` to the image buffer of `butterflywomanmask` and embed it as a clipping path in the metadata of `butterfly.jpg`, delivered as a JPEG at 90% quality (`$mask_ref:!butterflywomanmask!/e_embed_clipping_path:mask_$mask/q_90`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/$mask_ref:!butterflywomanmask!/e_embed_clipping_path:mask_$mask/q_90/butterfly.jpg
```

> Note
> `q_90` is specified explicitly because the default auto quality optimization strips embedded metadata from the delivered image. To preserve the clipping path in the output, you must set a fixed quality value. See [Metadata stripping](image_optimization#metadata_stripping) for details.

#### enhance

 `e_enhance`
Uses AI to analyze an image and make adjustments to enhance the appeal of the image, such as:

- **Exposure reduction**: Correcting overexposed images, smartly reducing excessive brightness and reclaiming details in bright areas, bringing back a balanced exposure.
- **Exposure enhancement**: Adjusting underexposed images by enhancing dim areas, thus improving overall exposure without compromising the image's natural quality.
- **Color intensification**: Enriching color vividness, making hues more vibrant and lively, thus bringing a more dynamic color range to the image.
- **Color temperature correction**: Adjusting the white balance, correcting color casts and ensuring that the colors in the image accurately reflect their real-world appearance.

Consider also using [generative restore](#gen_restore) to revitalize poor quality images, or the [improve](#improve) effect to automatically adjust color, contrast and brightness. See this [comparison of image enhancement options](effects_and_artistic_enhancements#image_enhancement_options).

> Notes and limitations:
>
> - During processing, large images are downscaled to a maximum of 4096 x 4096 pixels, then upscaled back to their original size, which may affect quality.
> - There is a [special transformation count](transformation_counts#special_effect_calculations) for the enhance effect.
> - The enhance effect is not supported for [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images.
> - If you're using our [Asia Pacific data center](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't apply the enhance effect.

```

#### extract

 `e_extract:prompt_(<prompt 1>[;...;<prompt n>])[;multiple_<detect multiple>][;mode_<mode>][;invert_<invert>][;preserve-alpha_<preserve alpha>]`
Extracts an area or multiple areas of an image, described in natural language. You can choose to keep the content of the extracted area(s) and make the rest of the image transparent (like background removal), or make the extracted area(s) transparent, keeping the content of the rest of the image. Alternatively, you can make a grayscale mask of the extracted area(s) or everything excluding the extracted area(s), which you can use with other transformations such as [e_mask](#mask), [e_multiply](#multiply), [e_overlay](#overlay) and [e_screen](#screen).

> Notes and limitations:
>
> - During processing, large images are downscaled to a maximum of 2048 x 2048 pixels, then upscaled back to their original size, which may affect quality.
> - This transformation changes the image's visual appearance by adjusting only the alpha channel, which controls transparency. The underlying RGB channel data remains unchanged and fully preserved, even in areas that become fully transparent.
> - When you specify more than one prompt, all the objects specified in each of the prompts will be extracted whether or not `multiple_true` is specified in the URL.
> - There is a [special transformation count](transformation_counts#special_effect_calculations) for the extract effect.
> - The extract effect is not supported for [animated](animated_images) images, [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images or [incoming transformations](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations).
> - [User-defined variables](user_defined_variables) cannot be used for the prompt when more than one prompt is specified.
> - When Cloudinary is generating a derived version, you may get a 423 response returned until the version is ready. You can prepare derived versions in advance using an [eager transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations).
> - When Cloudinary is generating an [incoming transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations), you may get a 420 response returned, with status `pending` until the asset is ready.
> - If you're using our [Asia Pacific data center](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't apply the extract effect.

#### gen_background_replace

 `e_gen_background_replace[:prompt_<prompt>][;seed_<seed>]`
Replaces the background of an image with an AI-generated background. If no prompt is specified, the background is based on the contents of the image. Otherwise, the background is based on the natural language prompt specified.

For images with transparency, the generated background replaces the transparent area. For images without transparency, the effect first determines the foreground elements and leaves those areas intact, while replacing the background.

Using different seeds, you can regenerate a background if you're not happy with the result.  You can also use seeds to return a previously generated result, as long as any other preceding transformation parameters are the same.

> Notes and limitations:
>
> - The use of generative AI means that results may not be 100% accurate.
> - There's a [special transformation count](transformation_counts#special_effect_calculations) for the generative background replace effect.
> - If you get blurred results when using this feature, it's likely that the built-in NSFW (Not Safe For Work) check has detected something inappropriate. You can [contact support](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to disable this check if you believe it's too sensitive.
> - The generative background replace effect isn't supported for [animated](animated_images) images or [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images.
> - When Cloudinary is generating a derived version, you may get a 423 response returned until the version is ready. You can prepare derived versions in advance using an [eager transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations).

#### gen_recolor

 `e_gen_recolor:prompt_(<prompt 1>[;...;<prompt n>]);to-color_<to color>[;apply-to-tier_(<tier 0>[;...;<tier n>])][;multiple_<detect multiple>]`
Uses generative AI to recolor parts of your image, maintaining the relative shading. Specify one or more prompts and the color to change them to. Use the `multiple` parameter to replace the color of all instances of the prompt when one prompt is given.

> Notes and limitations:
>
> - The generative recolor effect can only be used on non-transparent images.
> - The use of generative AI means that results may not be 100% accurate.
> - The generative recolor effect works best on simple objects that are clearly visible, and not abstract concepts such as "background".
> - Very small objects and very large objects may not be detected.
> - During processing, large images are downscaled to a maximum of 2048 x 2048 pixels, then upscaled back to their original size, which may affect quality.
> - When you specify more than one prompt, all the objects specified in each of the prompts will be recolored whether or not `multiple_true` is specified in the URL.
> - There is a [special transformation count](transformation_counts#special_effect_calculations) for the generative recolor effect.
> - The generative recolor effect isn't supported for [animated](animated_images) images or [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images.
> - [User-defined variables](user_defined_variables) can't be used for the prompt when more than one prompt is specified.
> - When Cloudinary is generating a derived version, you may get a 423 response returned until the version is ready. You can prepare derived versions in advance using an [eager transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations).
> - When Cloudinary is generating an [incoming transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations), you may get a 420 response returned, with status `pending` until the asset is ready.
> - If you're using our [Asia Pacific data center](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't apply the generative recolor effect.

> Tip
> Consider using [e_replace_color](#replace_color) if you want to recolor everything of a particular color in your image, rather than specific elements.

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prompt 1 to prompt n | string | **Required.** Natural language descriptions of what you want to replace the color of. |
| to color | string | **Required.** The target color. You can set it as: - A 3-digit RGB hex value (e.g. `FE7`) - A 6-digit RGB hex value (e.g. `A3CD10`) - A [named HTML color](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp) (e.g. `Blue`).

#### upscale

 `e_upscale`
Uses AI-based prediction to add fine detail while upscaling small images.

This 'super-resolution' feature scales each dimension by four, multiplying the total number of pixels by 16.

> Tip
> Also consider using other [image enhancement options](effects_and_artistic_enhancements#image_enhancement_options).

> Notes
>
> - To use the upscale effect, the input image must be smaller than 4.2 megapixels (the equivalent of 2048 x 2048 pixels).
> - There is a [special transformation count](transformation_counts#special_effect_calculations) for the upscale effect.
> - The upscale effect isn't supported for [animated](animated_images) images or [fetched](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files) images.
> - When Cloudinary is generating a derived version, you may get a 423 response returned until the version is ready. You can prepare derived versions in advance using an [eager transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#eager_transformations).
> - When Cloudinary is generating an [incoming transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations), you may get a 420 response returned, with status `pending` until the asset is ready.

Also known as the [Ken Burns effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_effect), this transformation applies zooming and/or panning to an image, resulting in a video or animated GIF (depending on the format you specify by either changing the [extension](#extension) or using the [format](#f-format) parameter).

You can either specify a mode, which is a predefined type of zoom/pan, or you can provide custom start and end positions for the zoom and pan. You can also use the `gravity` parameter to specify different start and end areas, such as objects, faces, and automatically determined areas of interest.

> Notes
>
> - The resulting video or animated GIF does not go outside the bounds of the original image. So, if you specify an x,y position of (0,0), for example, the center of the frame will be as close to the top left as possible, but will not be centered on that position.
> - The resolution of your image needs to be sufficient for the zoom level that you choose to maintain good quality.
> - To achieve the best visual quality, the output resolution of the resulting video or animated image should be less than or equal to the input image resolution divided by the maximum zoom level. For example, if your original image has a width of 1920 pixels, and your maximum zoom is 3.2, you should display the resulting video at a width of 600 pixels or less (e.g. chain `c_scale,w_600` onto the end of the transformation).
> - If you apply the `zoompan` effect to an animated image, the first frame of the animated image is taken as the input.
> - To achieve a smoother zoom, you can increase the frame rate, extend the length of the time over which the zoom occurs, and reduce the difference between zoom levels at the start and end of the transformation.
> - The `zoompan` effect won't work if the resulting video exceeds the limits set for your account. As a general rule, use images that don't exceed 5000 x 5000 pixels.
> - Currently, you can't use automatic gravity (`g_auto`) in other transformation components that are chained with the `zoompan` effect.

### eo (end offset)

 `eo_<time value>`
Specifies the last second to include in a video (or audio clip). This parameter is often used in conjunction with the [so (start offset)](#so-start-offset) and/or [du (duration)](#du-duration) parameters.

- Can be used independently to **trim** a video (or audio clip) by specifying the last second of the video to include. Everything after that second is trimmed off.
- Can be used as a [qualifier](#parameter-types) to control the timing of a corresponding transformation.

**As a qualifier, use with**: [e_boomerang](#boomerang) | [l_audio](#audio) | [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_video](#video)

**Learn more**: [Trimming videos](video_trimming#trimming_videos) | [Adding image overlays to videos](video_layers#image_overlays) | [Adding video overlays](video_layers#video_overlays)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time value | number | **Required.** The offset time from the end of the video (or audio clip).  Can be specified as a:  - float (in seconds) - a string, representing the time as a percentage of the video, in the format `##p` or `##%`. For example, `75p` represents the frame that is 75% from the beginning of the video |

##### Examples

  ```

### f (format)


Converts (if necessary) and delivers an asset in the specified format regardless of the file [extension](#extension) used in the delivery URL.

Must be used for automatic format selection ([f_auto](#auto-3)) as well as when [fetching remote assets](fetch_remote_images#fetch_and_deliver_remote_files), while the file extension for the delivery URL remains the original file extension.

In most other cases, you can optionally use this transformation to change the format as an alternative to changing the file [extension](#extension) of the public ID in the URL to a supported format. Both will give the same result.

> Note
> In SDK **major versions** with initial release earlier than 2020, the name of this parameter is `fetch_format`. These SDKs also have a `format` parameter, which is not a transformation parameter, but is used to change the file extension, as shown in the [file extension examples - #2](#examples).
> The later SDKs have a single `format` parameter (which parallels the behavior of the `fetch_format` parameter of older SDKs). You can use this to change the actual delivered format of any asset, but if you prefer to convert the asset to a different format by changing the extension of the public ID in the generated URL, you can do that in these later SDKs by specifying the desired extension as part of the public ID value, as shown in [file extension examples - #1](#examples).

#### &lt;supported format&gt;

 `f_<supported format>`
Converts and delivers an asset in the specified format.

##### Optional qualifier

[e_camera](#camera)

**Learn more**: [Fetch format](image_format_support#fetch_format) | [Transcoding videos to other formats](video_transcoding)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| supported format | string | **Required.** The format to use when delivering the asset. **Possible values**: Any supported delivery format as relevant for the file type you are delivering:  - [Supported image formats](image_format_support#supported_image_formats) - [Supported video formats](video_transcoding#supported_video_formats) - [Supported audio formats](audio_transformations#supported_audio_formats) |

##### Examples

1. Convert and deliver a Photoshop image in JPG format (`f_jpg`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/f_jpg/docs/cld_record_PSD.psd
  ```
2. Convert and deliver an MP4 video in WebM format (`f_webm`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/f_webm/guy_woman_mobile.mp4
  ```

#### auto

 `f_auto[:media type]`
Automatically generates (if needed) and delivers an asset in the optimal format for the requesting browser in order to minimize the file size.

Optionally, include a media type to ensure the asset is delivered with the desired media type when no file extension is included. For example, when delivering a video using `f_auto` and no file extension is provided, the media type will default to an image unless `f_auto:video` is used.

> Note
> When used in conjunction with [automatic quality (q_auto)](image_optimization#automatic_quality_selection_q_auto), sometimes the selected format is not the one that minimizes file size, but rather the format that yields the optimal balance between smaller file size and good visual quality.

**Learn more**: [Image automatic format selection](image_optimization#automatic_format_selection_f_auto) | [Video automatic format selection](video_transcoding#f_auto)

##### Optional qualifiers

[fl_animated](#animated) | [fl_attachment](#attachment) | [fl_preserve_transparency](#preserve_transparency)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| media type | string | The media type to use when delivering the asset. **Possible values**: `image`, `video`, `animated`. |

##### Examples

1. Deliver the `play.jpg` image as a WebP, AVIF or JPEG XL, depending on the browser (or as a regular JPEG to browsers that support none of the aforementioned formats):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/f_auto/docs/play.jpg
  ```
2. Deliver the video as WebM (VP9) to Chrome browsers, MP4 (HEVC) to Safari browsers, or as an MP4 (H.264) to browsers that support neither of the aforementioned formats:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/f_auto/guy_woman_mobile.mp4
  ```
3. Deliver the video with automatic format selection, ensuring it is delivered as a video when no file extension is used:
  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/f_auto:video/guy_woman_mobile
  ```

### fl (flag)


Alters the regular behavior of another transformation or the overall delivery behavior.

> Tip
> You can set multiple flags by separating the individual flags with a dot (`.`).

#### alternate

  `fl_alternate:lang_<language>[;name_<name>]`
Defines an audio layer to be used as an alternate audio track for videos delivered using [automatic streaming profile selection](adaptive_bitrate_streaming#automatic_streaming_profile_selection). Used to provide multiple audio tracks, for example when you want to provide audio in multiple languages.

**Use with**: [l_audio](#audio)

**Learn more**: [Defining alternate audio tracks](adaptive_bitrate_streaming#defining_alternate_audio_tracks)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| language | string | The IETF language tag and optional regional tag. For example `lang_en-US`. |
| name | string | The name for the audio track that will be shown in the player UI. For example `name_Description`. If no name is provided, the name will be inferred from the language. |

> Note
> This flag is not currently supported by our SDKs.

##### Example

Add an alternate instrumental audio track layer to the `outdoors` video alongside the original audio and deliver using automatic streaming profile selection to add the audio track to the generated manifest (`l_alternate:lang_en;name_Original,l_audio:outdoors/fl_alternate:lang_en;name_Instrumental,l_audio:docs:instrumental-short/sp_auto`).

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/fl_alternate:lang_en;name_Original,l_audio:outdoors/fl_layer_apply/fl_alternate:lang_en;name_Instrumental,l_audio:docs:instrumental-short/fl_layer_apply/sp_auto/outdoors.m3u8
```

#### animated

  `fl_animated`
Alters the regular video delivery behavior by delivering a video file as an animated image instead of a single frame image, when specifying an image format that supports both still and animated images, such as `webp` or `avif`.

**Use with**: [fl_apng](#apng) | [fl_awebp](#awebp) | [f_auto](#auto-3)

> Note
> When delivering a video and specifying the GIF format (either f_gif or specifying a GIF extension) it's automatically delivered as an animated GIF and this flag is not necessary. To force Cloudinary to [deliver a single frame of a video](animated_images#deliver_a_single_frame) in GIF format, use the `page` parameter.

**Learn more**: [Converting videos to animated images](videos_to_animated_images)

##### Example

Generate an animated WebP from the uploaded mp4 video named `guy_woman_mobile`, using a sample of 10 frames from the original video and setting a delay of 100 milliseconds between the frames of the resulting animated WebP (`fl_awebp,fl_animated`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/vs_10,dl_100,w_250,fl_awebp,fl_animated/guy_woman_mobile.webp
```

#### any_format

  `fl_any_format`
Alters the regular behavior of the [q_auto](#auto-5) parameter, allowing it to switch to PNG8 encoding if the automatic quality algorithm decides that's more efficient.

**Use with**: [q_auto](#auto-5)

#### apng

  `fl_apng`
The `apng` (animated PNG) flag alters the regular PNG delivery behavior by delivering an animated image asset in animated PNG format rather than a still PNG image. Keep in mind that animated PNGs are not supported in all browsers and versions.

**Use with**: [fl_animated](#animated) | [f_png](#supported-format) (or when specifying `png` as the delivery URL file extension).

##### Example

Generate and deliver an animated PNG from the animated GIF file called `spiral_animated` (`fl_apng`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fl_apng/spiral_animated.png
```

> Note
> Depending on the formats supported by the browser you are currently using, you may or may not see the above image as an animated PNG.

#### attachment

  `fl_attachment[:<filename>]`
Alters the regular delivery URL behavior, causing the URL link to download the (transformed) file as an attachment rather than embedding it in your Web page or application.

> Note
> You can also use this flag with [raw files](upload_parameters#uploading_non_media_files_as_raw_files) to specify a custom filename for the download. The generated file's extension will match the raw file's original extension.

**Use with**: [f_auto](#auto-3)

**See also**: [fl_streaming_attachment](#streaming_attachment)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filename | string | The filename to use for the downloaded attachment. Specify the filename only, without an extension. The file format (and extension) for the download will be the same as it would otherwise have been delivered in. For example, if you use `f_auto` in the same transformation, the format (and corresponding extension) of the downloaded file will be the format that would have been delivered.  **Permitted characters**: letter (`A-Z` / `a-z`), number (`0-9`), underscore (`_`), hyphen (`-`),  exclamation mark (`!`) and space. You can include a period (`.`) character in the filename by double-escaping it as: `%252E`.   **Default**: The filename the asset had when it was uploaded, unless the [discard_original_filename](image_upload_api_reference#upload_discard_original_filename) parameter was set during upload. In that scenario only, the `public_id` value is the default download filename. |

##### Example

Deliver an image as a downloadable attachment with a custom filename. (Clicking the URL link below downloads the file instead of opening the image in a new browser window):

Note that because `f_auto` is used, the downloaded file extension is based on the actual delivered file format and not the extension of the URL. For example, an AVIF file will be delivered if you click this link from Chrome.

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/f_auto/fl_attachment:pretty_flower/docs/flower_shop.jpg
```

#### awebp

  `fl_awebp`
The `awebp` (animated WebP) flag alters the regular WebP delivery behavior by delivering an animated image or video asset in animated WebP format rather than as a still WebP image. Keep in mind that animated WebPs are not supported in all browsers and versions.

**Use with**: [fl_animated](#animated) | [f_webp](#supported-format) (or when specifying `webp` as the delivery URL file extension).

##### Example

Generate and deliver an animated WebP from the animated GIF file called `kitten_fighting` (`fl_awebp`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fl_awebp/kitten_fighting.webp
```

> Note
> Depending on the formats supported by the browser you are currently using, you may or may not see the above image as an animated WebP.

#### c2pa

  `fl_c2pa`
Use the `c2pa` flag when delivering images that you want to be signed by Cloudinary for the purposes of C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity).

**Learn more**: [Content provenance and authenticity](content_provenance_and_authenticity)

##### Example

Add a signature in a new manifest when delivering the `freckles` image (`fl_c2pa`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_550/fl_c2pa/docs/freckles
```

#### clip

  `fl_clip`
For images with a clipping path saved with the originally uploaded image (e.g. manually created using Photoshop), makes everything outside the clipping path transparent.

If there are multiple paths stored in the file, you can indicate which clipping path to use by specifying either the path number or name as the value of the page parameter (`pg` in URLs).

**Use with**: [pg (page or file layer)](#pg-page-or-file-layer)

**See also**: [g_clipping_path](#clipping_path)

##### Examples

1. Deliver a transparent version of an earrings image, where the non-transparency is based on the second clipping path in the uploaded PSD file (`fl_clip`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fl_clip,pg_2/docs/earings_psd_paths.png
  ```
2. Deliver a transparent version of an earrings image, where the non-transparency is based on the clipping path named `stones` in the uploaded PSD file:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fl_clip,pg_name:stones/docs/earings_psd_named_paths.png
  ```
3. Deliver a transparent version of a car image, where the non-transparency is based on the clipping path named `front` in the uploaded TIFF file:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fl_clip,pg_name:front/docs/cp/car_trans.png
  ```

#### clip_evenodd

  `fl_clip_evenodd`
For images with a clipping path saved with the originally uploaded image, makes pixels transparent based on the clipping path using the 'evenodd' clipping rule to determine whether points are inside or outside of the path.

##### Example

Deliver a transparent version of an earrings image using the 'evenodd' clipping rule (`fl_clip_evenodd`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fl_clip_evenodd/docs/earings_psd_paths.png
```

#### cutter

  `fl_cutter`
Trims the pixels on the base image according to the transparency levels of a specified overlay image. Where the overlay image is opaque, the original is kept and displayed, and wherever the overlay is transparent, the base image becomes transparent as well. This results in a delivered image displaying the base image content trimmed to the exact shape of the overlay image.

> Note
> The same [layer transformation syntax](layers#layer_transformation_syntax) rules apply, including for [authenticated or private assets](layers#authenticated_or_private_layers).

**Learn more**: [Shape cutouts: keep a shape](effects_and_artistic_enhancements#keep_a_shape)

##### Examples

1. Trim a photo based on a hexagon shaped overlay with feathering. The partial transparency of the feathering in the overlay results in a blurred (partial transparency) effect in the trimming (`l_hexagon_feather_sample/fl_cutter`). Prior to applying the overlay, the base image is cropped to match the size of the hexagon overlay, using `g_face` to keep the face in the crop:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_thumb,g_face,h_220,w_200/l_hexagon_feather_sample/fl_cutter,fl_layer_apply/face_left.png
  ```
2. Trim a (fetched) image of a water drop based on the shape of a text overlay definition  (`l_text:Unkempt_250_bold:Water/fl_cutter`). The text overlay is defined with the desired font and size of the resulting delivered image:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/fetch/f_png/c_scale,w_800/l_text:Unkempt_250_bold:Water/e_shadow/fl_cutter,fl_layer_apply/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Water_drop_impact_on_a_water-surface_-_%281%29.jpg
  ```
3. Transform a picture into an old photograph by using an image of torn paper to trim the picture, and again, as a layer with opacity of 40 to achieved a weathered look:

  ```

```

#### force_icc

  `fl_force_icc`
Adds ICC color space metadata to an image, even when the original image doesn't contain any ICC data.

#### force_strip

  `fl_force_strip`
Instructs Cloudinary to clear all image metadata (IPTC, Exif and XMP) while applying an [incoming transformation](eager_and_incoming_transformations#incoming_transformations).

#### getinfo

  `fl_getinfo`
**For images**: returns information about both the input asset and the transformed output asset in JSON instead of delivering a transformed image.

**For videos**: returns an empty JSON file unless one of the qualifiers below is used.

Not applicable to files delivered in certain formats, such as animated GIF, PDF and 3D formats.

As a [qualifier](#parameter-types), returns additional data as detailed below.

**Use with**:

- [g_auto](#auto-4):


  - For images, the returned JSON includes the cropping coordinates recommended by the `g_auto` algorithm.
  - For videos, the returned JSON includes the cropping confidence score for the whole video and per second in addition to the horizontal center point of each frame (on a scale of 0 to 1) recommended by the `g_auto` algorithm.
- [g_&lt;face-specific-gravity&gt;](#special-position):  For images, the returned JSON includes the coordinates of facial landmarks relative to the top-left corner of the original image.
- [e_preview](#preview): For videos, the returned JSON includes an importance histogram for the video.

  ```

  > Tip
  > Click the URL to see the JSON response.

#### group4

  `fl_group4`
Applies **Group 4 compression** to the image. Currently applicable to TIFF files only. If the original image is in color, it is transformed to black and white before the compression is applied.

**Use with**: [f_tiff](#supported-format) (or when specifying `tiff` as the delivery URL file extension)

##### Example

Apply Group 4 compression to a TIFF image of an elephant:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fl_group4/docs/elephant-front.tiff
```

#### hlsv3

  `fl_hlsv3`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that delivers an HLS adaptive bitrate streaming file as HLS v3 instead of the default version (HLS v4).

This flag is supported only for product environments with a private CDN configuration.

**Use with**: [sp (streaming profile)](#sp-streaming-profile)

**Learn more**: [Adaptive bitrate streaming](adaptive_bitrate_streaming)

#### ignore_aspect_ratio

  `fl_ignore_aspect_ratio`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that adjusts the behavior of scale cropping. By default, when only one dimension (width or height) is supplied, the other dimension is automatically calculated to maintain the aspect ratio. When this flag is supplied together with a single dimension, the other dimension keeps its original value, thus distorting an image by scaling in only one direction.

**Use with**: [c_scale](#scale)

##### Example

Resize the height of an image to 150 pixels, while retaining the original width (`c_scale,fl_ignore_aspect_ratio,h_150`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,fl_ignore_aspect_ratio,h_150/docs/camera-640.jpg
```

#### ignore_mask_channels

  `fl_ignore_mask_channels`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that ensures that an alpha channel is not applied to a TIFF image if it is a mask channel.

**Use with**: [f_tiff](#supported-format) (or when specifying `tiff` as the delivery URL file extension)

#### immutable_cache

  `fl_immutable_cache`
Sets the cache-control for an image to be immutable, which instructs the browser that an image does not have to be revalidated with the server when the page is refreshed, and can be loaded directly from the cache. Currently supported only in Firefox.

#### keep_attribution

  `keep_attribution`
Cloudinary's default behavior is to strip almost all metadata from a delivered image when generating new image transformations. Applying this flag alters this default behavior, and keeps all the copyright-related fields while still stripping the rest of the metadata.

**Learn more**: [Default optimizations](image_optimization#default_optimizations)

**See also**: [fl_keep_iptc](#keep_iptc)

> Note
> This flag works well when delivering images in JPG format. It may not always work as expected for other image formats.

#### keep_dar

  `fl_keep_dar`
When Cloudinary processes a video-to-video transformation, it resets the Display Aspect Ratio (DAR) metadata to match the output pixel dimensions. The crop modes affected by this reset are [c_scale](#scale), [c_fit](#fit), [c_limit](#limit), [c_fill](#fill), and [c_pad](#pad). Apply `fl_keep_dar` to preserve the original DAR metadata instead.

This is useful for anamorphic video content, where the storage resolution differs from the intended display resolution. For example, a video might store pixels at 1440x1080 but use DAR metadata to tell players to display it at 1920x1080 (16:9). Without `fl_keep_dar`, Cloudinary removes that metadata during transformation.

> Note
> Using `fl_keep_dar` with [c_fill](#fill) on anamorphic video can cause the output to appear stretched or squished. For details and guidance, see [Cropping videos with non-standard DAR](video_crop_modes#cropping_videos_with_non_standard_dar).

> Best practice: Preserve the Source Display Aspect Ratio
>
> Some source videos include both Sample Aspect Ratio (SAR) and Display Aspect Ratio (DAR) metadata. When you deliver the original asset, players may honor the source DAR, so the displayed frame can differ from the pixel dimensions. When you apply transformations (for example, resizing), SAR may determine the rendered dimensions, which can make the output appear stretched or squashed relative to the source's displayed shape.
>
>
> To keep the displayed shape aligned with the source DAR when transforming, add the `fl_keep_dar` flag to the transformation:
>
>
> Example:
>
>
>
> ```
> https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/c_fill,w_800,ar_16:9,fl_keep_dar/meadow_walk.mp4
> ```
>
>
> This preserves the source Display Aspect Ratio even if it differs from the transformation’s calculated dimensions.

#### keep_iptc

  `fl_keep_iptc`
Cloudinary's default behavior is to strip almost all embedded metadata from a delivered image when generating new image transformations. Applying this flag alters this default behavior, and keeps all of an image's embedded metadata in the transformed image.

> Note
> This flag cannot be used in conjunction with [q_auto](#auto-5).

**Learn more**: [Default optimizations](image_optimization#default_optimizations)

**See also**: [fl_keep_attribution](#keep_attribution)

##### Example

The following example resizes an image to a width of 400 pixels and keeps all the embedded metadata in a delivered image (`w_400,fl_keep_iptc`). As a result, this delivered image is 94.69 KB. The same transformation without this flag is 68.97 KB:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/fl_keep_iptc/beach_two_kids.jpg
```

#### layer_apply

  `fl_layer_apply`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that enables you to apply chained transformations to an overlaid image or video. The first component of the overlay (`l_<image_id>`) acts as an opening parentheses of the overlay transformation and the `fl_layer_apply` component acts as the ending parentheses. Any transformation components between these two are applied as chained transformations to the overlay and not to the base asset.

This flag is also required when concatenating images to videos or concatenating videos with custom transitions.

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_audio](#audio) | [l_video](#video)

**Learn more**:

- [Applying multiple transformations to overlays](layers#multiple_layer_transformations_fl_layer_apply)
- [Concatenate videos with images](video_concatenation#concatenate_videos_with_images)
- [Concatenate videos with custom transitions](video_transition_effects#custom_transitions)

##### Example

The base image is scaled to a width of 500 pixels before adding an image overlay, where the overlay is automatically cropped to a 150px thumbnail including only the detected face and placed in the top left corner (`c_scale,w_500/l_docs:model/c_thumb,g_face,w_150/fl_layer_apply,g_north_west`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_500/l_docs:model/c_thumb,g_face,w_150/fl_layer_apply,g_north_west/docs/man-rocks-sea.jpg
```

#### lossy

  `fl_lossy`
When used with an animated GIF file, instructs Cloudinary to use lossy compression when delivering an animated GIF. By default a quality of 80 is applied when delivering with lossy compression. You can use this flag in conjunction with a specified `q_<quality_level>` to deliver a higher or lower quality level of lossy compression.

When used while delivering a PNG format, instructs Cloudinary to deliver an image in PNG format (as requested) unless there is no transparency channel, in which case, deliver in JPEG format instead.

**Use with**: [f_gif](#supported-format) with or without [q_&lt;quality level&gt;](#quality-level) | [f_png](#supported-format)

(or when specifying `gif` or `png` as the delivery URL file extension)

**Learn more**: [Applying lossy GIF compression](animated_images#applying_lossy_gif_compression)

##### Example

The original `kitten_fighting` animated GIF has a file size of 6.3 MB without lossy compression. By delivering it with lossy compression and a quality of 50, the file size is reduced to 1.96 MB (33% of its original size) and still has acceptable quality:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/f_gif,fl_lossy/q_50/kitten_fighting.gif
```

#### mono

  `fl_mono`
Converts the audio channel in a video or audio file to mono. This can help to optimize your video files if stereo sound is not essential.

##### Example

Deliver the `big_buck_bunny` with mono audio:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/du_10.0,so_43.0/fl_mono/Big_Buck_Bunny.mp4
```

#### no_overflow

  `fl_no_overflow`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that prevents an image or text overlay from extending a delivered image canvas beyond the dimensions of the base image

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_text](#text)

**See also**: [fl_text_disallow_overflow](#text_disallow_overflow)

##### Example

In the example below, a base image is scaled down to a width of 400. The logo overlay is larger than the resized image. Without the `fl_no_overflow` flag, a delivered image would increase the size of a delivered image to display the entire overlay. By applying the flag, a transformed image with the overlay is cropped to the dimensions of a resized base image:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/l_cloudinary_icon_blue/fl_layer_apply,fl_no_overflow/flower.jpg
```

#### no_stream

  `fl_no_stream`
Prevents a video that is currently being generated on the fly from beginning to stream until the video is fully generated.

#### original

  `fl_original`
Delivers the original asset instead of applying the settings enabled in the **Optimize by default** section of the **Optimization** settings.

> Notes
>
> - The use of this flag does not incur a transformation charge.
> - The **Optimize by default** settings are available to certain plans only.

**Learn more**: [Optimize by default settings](optimize_by_default_settings)

#### png8 / png24 / png32

  `fl_png8` `fl_png24` `fl_png32`
By default, Cloudinary delivers PNGs in PNG-24 format, or if [f_auto](#auto-3) and [q_auto](#auto-5) are used, these determine the PNG format that minimizes file size while maximizing quality. In some cases, the algorithm will select PNG-8. By specifying one of these flags when delivering a PNG file, you can override the default Cloudinary behavior and force the requested PNG format.

**See also**: [fl_any_format](#any_format)

#### preserve_transparency

  `fl_preserve_transparency`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that ensures that the [f_auto](#auto-3) parameter will always deliver in a transparent format if the image has a transparency channel.

**Use with**: [f_auto](#auto-3)

#### progressive

  `fl_progressive[:<mode>]`
Generates a JPG or PNG image using the progressive (interlaced) format. This format allows the browser to quickly show a low-quality rendering of the image until the full quality image is loaded.

> Tip
>
> You can also apply `fl_progressive` to single-frame (static) GIF images.

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mode | constant | Adjusts the rendering of the progressive rendering.  **Possible values**:  - `progressive:semi` For JPG images only. Delivers the progressive image using a smart optimization of the decoding time, compression level and progressive rendering (fewer iterations). - `progressive:steep`: For JPG images only. Delivers a preview very quickly, and in a single later phase, improves the image to the required resolution. - `progressive:none`: - Do not deliver a progressive image.  **Default**:  - If used in conjunction with [q_auto](#auto-5) (or if `q_auto` is set as the default image quality in your [Optimization Settings](https://console.cloudinary.com/app/settings/optimization)): `progressive:semi` - If used in conjunction with [q_&lt;quality level&gt;](#quality-level) (or if a specific quality level is set as the default quality in your Settings): `progressive:none` |

#### rasterize

  `fl_rasterize`
Reduces a vector image to one flat pixelated layer, enabling transformations like PDF resizing and overlays.

#### region_relative

  `fl_region_relative`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that instructs Cloudinary to interpret percentage-based ( e.g. 0.8) width and height values for an image layer (overlay or underlay), as a percentage that is relative to the size of the defined or automatically detected region(s). For example, the region may be the coordinates of an automatically detected face or piece of text, or a custom-defined region.  If an image has multiple regions, then the specified overlay image will be overlaid over each identified region at a size relative to the region it overlays.

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [u (underlay)](#u-underlay)

                        AND

one of the following [special gravities](#special-position): `adv_eyes`, `adv_faces`, `custom` `face`, `faces`, `ocr_text`

**Learn more**:

- [Placing images over detected faces](face_detection_based_transformations#position_overlays_on_detected_faces)

- [OCR Text Detection and Extraction Add-on - Overlaying text with images](ocr_text_detection_and_extraction_addon#overlaying_detected_text_with_images)

##### Examples

1. Hide all the faces in an image by covering them with an emoji overlay, where each overlay is sized at 1.3x (130%) of each detected face:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/l_happy_smiley/c_scale,fl_region_relative,w_1.3/fl_layer_apply,g_faces/rollercoaster.jpg
  ```
2. Place the 'call text' image over each detected text region in the image at 1.1x (110%) of each detected text region. This transformation uses `g_ocr_text`, which triggers the [OCR Text Detection and Extraction Add-on](ocr_text_detection_and_extraction_addon) to detect the text regions and pass those back to the transformation on the fly:

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/l_call_text/c_scale,fl_region_relative,w_1.1/fl_layer_apply,g_ocr_text/home_4_sale.jpg
  ```

#### relative

  `fl_relative`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that instructs Cloudinary to interpret percentage-based ( e.g. 0.8) width and height values for an image layer (overlay or underlay), as a percentage that is relative to the size of the base image, rather than relative to the original size of the specified overlay image. This flag enables you to use the same transformation to add an overlay to images that will always resize to a relative size of whatever image it overlays.

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [u (underlay)](#u-underlay)

**Learn more**: [Transforming overlays](image_layer_transformations)

##### Example

Add a logo overlay to the north-east corner of an image at 30% of the width of the base image:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/l_cloudinary_icon_blue/c_scale,fl_relative,w_0.3/fl_layer_apply,g_north_east/leather_bag_gray.jpg
```

#### replace_image

  `fl_replace_image`
A qualifier that takes the image specified as an overlay and uses it to replace the first image embedded in a PDF.

Transformation parameters that modify the appearance of the overlay (such as effects) can be applied. However, when this flag is used, the overlay image is always scaled exactly to the dimensions of the image it replaces. Therefore, resize transformations applied to the overlay are ignored. For this reason, it is important that the image specified in the overlay matches the aspect ratio of the image in the PDF that it will replace.

> Note
> The same [layer transformation syntax](layers#layer_transformation_syntax) rules apply, including for [authenticated or private assets](layers#authenticated_or_private_layers).

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image_id&gt;](#image-id)

##### Example

Replace the photo of the woman that appears on the first page of the [original PDF](https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/docs/sample_photos_PDF.pdf) with a cartoonified version of the `leather_bag` image (`e_cartoonify,fl_replace_image,l_leather_bag`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/e_cartoonify,fl_replace_image,l_leather_bag/docs/sample_photos_PDF.pdf
```

#### sanitize

  `fl_sanitize`
Relevant only for the SVG images. Runs a sanitizer on the image.

#### splice

  `fl_splice[:transition[_([name_<transition name>][;du_<transition duration>])]]`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that concatenates (splices) the image, video or audio file specified as an overlay to a base video (instead of placing it as an overlay). By default, the overlay image, video or audio file is spliced to the end of the base video. You can use the [start offset](#so-start-offset) parameter set to `0` (`so_0`) to splice the overlay asset to the beginning of the base video by specifying it alongside `fl_layer_apply`. You can optionally provide a [cross fade transition](video_transition_effects#cross_fade_transitions) between assets.

> Note
> Make sure you read the [important notes](video_concatenation#before_you_start) regarding concatenating media.

**Use with**: [l_audio](#audio) | [l_video](#video)

  ```

#### streaming_attachment

  `fl_streaming_attachment[:<filename>]`
Like [fl_attachment](#attachment), this flag alters the regular video delivery URL behavior, causing the URL link to download the (transformed) video as an attachment rather than embedding it in your Web page or application.  Additionally, if the video transformation is being requested and generated for the first time, this flag causes the video download to begin immediately, streaming it as a fragmented video file.
(Most standard video players successfully play fragmented video files without issue.)

(In contrast, if the regular `fl_attachment` flag is used, then when a user requests the video transformation for the first time, the download will begin only after the complete transformed video has been generated.)

> Note
> HLS (.m3u8) and MPEG-DASH (.mpd) files are by nature non-streamable. If this flag is used with a video in one of those formats, it behaves identically to the regular `fl_attachment` flag.

**See also:** [fl_attachment](#attachment)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filename | string | The filename to use for the downloaded attachment. Specify the filename only, without an extension. The file format (and extension) for the download will be the same as it would otherwise have been delivered in. For example, if you use [f_auto](#auto-3) in the same transformation, the format (and corresponding extension) of the downloaded file will be the format that would have been delivered.  **Permitted characters**: letter (`A-Z` / `a-z`), number (`0-9`), underscore (`_`), hyphen (`-`),  exclamation mark (`!`) and space. You can include a period (`.`) character in the filename by double-escaping it as: `%252E`.   **Default**: The filename the asset had when it was uploaded, unless the [discard_original_filename](image_upload_api_reference#upload_discard_original_filename) parameter was set during upload. In that scenario only, the `public_id` value is the default download filename. |

##### Example

Deliver a video URL that downloads the transformed video with the filename `shoe-sale` (`fl_streaming_attachment:shoe-sale`).  Because `f_auto` is used in the transformation, the downloaded extension will be the format automatically selected for the browser and device that requests it. For example, in Chrome, the file will probably be downloaded as `shoe-sale.webm`:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/c_scale,w_500/f_auto/fl_streaming_attachment:shoe-sale/walking.mp4
```

#### strip_profile

  `fl_strip_profile`
Converts non-sRGB images to sRGB and then strips the ICC profile data from the delivered image.

#### text_disallow_overflow

  `fl_text_disallow_overflow`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) used with text overlays that fails the transformation and returns a 400 (bad request) error if the text (in the requested size and font) exceeds the base image boundaries. This can be useful if the expected text of the overlay and/or the size of the base image isn't known in advance, for example with [user-generated content](user_generated_content). You can check for this error and if it occurs, let the user who supplied the text know that they should change the font, font size, or number of characters (or alternatively that they should provide a larger base image).

**Use with**: [l_text](#text)

**See also**: [fl_no_overflow](#no_overflow)

##### Example

The requested text overlay (at font size 100) exceeds the requested 400px width of the base flower image. Make sure that in this case, the image transformation isn't generated and a `400` error returns (`co_yellow,fl_text_disallow_overflow,l_text:Arial_100:Big%20Flowers,`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/co_yellow,fl_text_disallow_overflow,l_text:Arial_100:Big%20Flowers/fl_layer_apply/flower.jpg
```

> For comparison:

- If you deliver the above transformation, but without any flags, the text would extend the overall width of the delivered image to display the text in its entirety.
- If you deliver the above transformation with the `fl_no_overflow` flag instead of the `fl_text_disallow_overflow` flag, the image would be delivered according to the requested dimensions, and any excess text would be cut off.)

#### text_no_trim

  `fl_text_no_trim`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) used with text overlays that adds a small amount of padding around the text overlay string. Without this flag, the text overlay trims tightly to the text with no excess padding.

With `fl_text_no_trim`, text overlays preserve baseline padding, making alignment consistent across strings with different letter shapes.

> Note
> If you place a background behind a text overlay (for example, using `b_rgb` or a background underlay), the background option typically adds padding automatically, so this flag isn’t required for that case.

Because trimming is based on the rendered text bounds, different strings may produce slightly different trimmed heights (for example, strings that include descenders such as **j**, **g**, or **y**). This can lead to small placement differences when you apply the same positioning (e.g., `g_south`, `y_2`) to different text values.

To keep placement consistent across strings, add `fl_text_no_trim` to introduce a small amount of padding around the rendered text.

**Use with**: [l_text](#text)

##### Example

**Aligning separate text layers**

When overlaying multiple independent text layers, default trimming can cause small differences in the visual height of each layer (e.g., due to ascenders/descenders), which in turn can affect apparent alignment when using gravity (such as `g_west` or `g_center`). To ensure consistent anchoring and spacing, add `fl_text_no_trim` to each text layer:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/l_text:Arial_130:San%20Francisco,fl_text_no_trim/l_text:Arial_130:Golden%20City,fl_text_no_trim/g_west,fl_layer_apply,x_w_add_20/fl_layer_apply,g_center/photo-1430609098125-581618d0482f_xvayby
```

#### tiff8_lzw

  `fl_tiff8_lzw`
A qualifier that generates TIFF images in the TIFF8 format using LZW compression.

**Use with**: [f_tiff](#supported-format) (or when specifying `tiff` as the delivery URL file extension)

#### tiled

  `fl_tiled`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that tiles the specified image overlay over the entire image. This can be useful for adding a watermark effect.

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id)

**Learn more**: [Automatic tiling](layers#automatic_tiling)

##### Example

Tile a semi-transparent (opaqueness 30%) logo overlay over the entire image to achieve a watermark effect (`l_cloudinary_icon_white/c_scale,w_200/o_30/fl_layer_apply,fl_tiled`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/l_cloudinary_icon_white/c_scale,w_200/o_30/fl_layer_apply,fl_tiled/flower.jpg
```

#### truncate_ts

  `fl_truncate_ts`
Truncates (trims) a video file based on the times defined in the video file's metadata (relevant only where the file metadata includes a directive to play only a section of the video).

#### waveform

  `fl_waveform`
Instead of delivering the audio or video file, generates and delivers a waveform image in the requested image format based on the audio from the audio or video file. by default, the waveform color is white and the background is black. You can customize these using the [co_&lt;color&gt;](#co-color) and [b_&lt;color value&gt;](#color-value)

##### Optional qualifiers

[b_&lt;color value&gt;](#color-value) | [co_&lt;color&gt;](#co-color)

**Learn more**: [Auto-generated waveform images](audio_transformations#auto_generated_waveform_images)

##### Example

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/c_scale,h_200,w_500/b_grey,co_darkblue,fl_waveform/dog.png
```

### fn (custom function)

 `fn_<function type>:<source>`
Injects a custom function into the image transformation pipeline. You can use a remote function/lambda as your source, run WebAssembly functions from a compiled **.wasm** file stored in your Cloudinary product environment, deliver assets based on filters using tags and structured metadata, or filter assets returned when generating a client-side list.

**Learn more**: [Custom functions](custom_functions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| function type | constant | **Required.** The type of function to run.  **Possible values**:  `remote`, `select`, `refine`, `render` or `wasm`. |
| source | string | **Required.** The source of the custom function, either the public ID of the wasm file, the base64 encoded URL of the remote function, the video rendering parameters, the jq filter to use, or the public ID of the JavaScript file. |

##### Example

Inject an uploaded wasm file to quantize an image to use only 5 colors (passed as a [variable](user_defined_variables#user_defined_variables_overview)) (`$colors_5/fn_wasm:quantize.wasm`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/$colors_5/fn_wasm:quantize.wasm/oldman_village_st.jpg
```

### fps (FPS)

 `fps_<frames per second>[-<maximum frames per second>]`
Controls the FPS (Frames Per Second) of a video or animated image to ensure that the asset (even when optimized) is delivered with an expected FPS level (for video, this helps with sync to audio). Can also be specified as a range.

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frames per second | integer | **Required.** The frames per second for the video or animated image. If a maximum frames per second value is also given, then this value is regarded as a minimum value. |
| maximum frames per second | integer | The maximum frames per second for the video or animated image. **Default**: `frames per second` value. |

##### Examples

1. Set the FPS for a video to between 1 and 5 frames per second (`fps_1-5`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/fps_1-5/surfers.mp4
  ```
2. Set the FPS for an animated image to 8 frames per second (`fps_8`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/fps_8/kitten_fighting.gif
  ```

### g (gravity)


A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that determines which part of an asset to focus on, and thus which part of the asset to keep, when any part of the asset is cropped. For overlays, this setting determines where to place the overlay.

**Learn more**: [Control image gravity](image_gravity) | [Control video gravity](video_resizing_and_cropping#control_gravity)

#### &lt;compass position&gt;

 `g_<compass position>`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that defines a fixed location within an asset to focus on.

**Use with**: [c_auto - image only](#auto-1) | [c_crop](#crop) | [c_fill](#fill) | [c_lfill](#lfill) | [c_lpad](#lpad) | [c_mpad](#mpad) | [c_pad](#pad) | [c_thumb](#thumb) | [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_fetch](#fetch) | [l_text](#text) | [l_subtitles](#subtitles) | [l_video](#video) | [u_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id-1) | [u_fetch](#fetch-1) | [x, y (x & y coordinates)](#x-y-x-y-coordinates)

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_south,h_150,w_200/docs/flower_shop.jpg
```

#### &lt;special position&gt;

 `g_<special position>`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that defines a special position within the asset to focus on.

> Note
> The only special position that is supported for [animated images](animated_images) is `custom`. If other positions are specified in an animated image transformation, `center` gravity is applied.

**Use with**: [c_auto](#auto-1) | [c_crop](#crop) | [c_fill](#fill) | [c_lfill](#lfill) | [c_scale](#scale) (for `g_liquid` only) | [c_thumb](#thumb) | [e_pixelate_region](#pixelate_region) | [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_fetch](#fetch) | [l_text](#text)  | [u_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id-1) | [u_fetch](#fetch-1) | [x, y (x & y coordinates)](#x-y-x-y-coordinates)

**See also**: [fl_getinfo](#getinfo)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| special position | constant | **Required.** The position to focus on. **Note**: The fallback (default) values mentioned below are only relevant when setting gravity for [cropping modes](#c-cropresize) and not when setting gravity for [placing overlays](#l-layer). For example, if gravity is set to 'face' for placing an overlay, and no face is detected in the image, then the overlay is ignored. One of the following special positions: - `adv_eyes` - Automatically detect all eyes in an image with the [Advanced Facial Attribute Detection add-on](advanced_facial_attributes_detection_addon#eyes_detection_based_cropping) and make them the focus of the transformation. - `adv_face` - Automatically detect the largest face in an image with the [Advanced Facial Attribute Detection add-on](advanced_facial_attributes_detection_addon#face_detection_based_cropping) and make it the focus of the transformation. - `adv_faces` - Automatically detect all faces in an image with the [Advanced Facial Attribute Detection add-on](advanced_facial_attributes_detection_addon#face_detection_based_cropping) and make them the focus of the transformation. - `cld-decompose_tile` - For use on images that are composed of several images (effectively tiled), automatically detect the composite tiles of the image and make the largest tile the focus of the crop (see [example](#examples_g_special_position_tile)). - `custom` - Use [custom coordinates](custom_focus_areas#custom_coordinates) that were previously specified (e.g., as part of the image [upload method](image_upload_api_reference#upload)) and make them the focus of the transformation. Uses the largest of the areas defined if more than one set of coordinates is defined. Defaults to `center` gravity if no custom coordinates have been specified. - `custom:face` - Same as `custom` gravity, but defaults to `face` gravity if no custom coordinates have been specified. - `custom:adv_face` - Same as `custom` gravity, but defaults to `adv_face` gravity if no custom coordinates have been specified. - `custom:adv_faces` -  Same as `custom` gravity, but defaults to `adv_faces` gravity if no custom coordinates have been specified. - `custom:faces` - Same as `custom` gravity, but defaults to `faces` gravity if no custom coordinates have been specified. - `face` - Automatically detect the largest [face](face_detection_based_transformations#face_detection_based_cropping) in an image and make it the focus of the transformation. Any previously specified face coordinates (during [upload](image_upload_api_reference#upload), with the [Admin API](admin_api#update_details_of_an_existing_resource), or via the [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/console)) override the automatically detected faces and are used instead. Defaults to `north` gravity if no face is detected or previously specified. You can also use `face:auto` or `face:center` so that the gravity will default to [auto](#auto-4) or `center` if no [face](face_detection_based_transformations#face_detection_based_cropping) is detected or specified. - `face:center` - Same as `face` gravity, but defaults to `center` gravity if no face is detected. - `faces` - Same as `face` gravity, but detects all the [faces](face_detection_based_transformations#face_detection_based_cropping) in an image and uses the rectangle containing all face coordinates as the basis of the transformation. Any previously specified face coordinates (during [upload](image_upload_api_reference#upload), with the [Admin API](admin_api#update_details_of_an_existing_resource), or via the [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/console)) override the automatically detected faces and are used instead. Defaults to `north` gravity if no faces are detected or previously specified. You can also use `faces:auto` or `faces:center` so that the gravity will default to [auto](#auto-4) or `center` if no faces are detected or specified. - `faces:center` - Same as `faces` gravity, but defaults to `center` gravity if no [face](face_detection_based_transformations#face_detection_based_cropping) is detected.`liquid` - uses content-aware [liquid rescaling](image_gravity#liquid_rescaling) to remove 'seams' of pixels that may zig zag horizontally or vertically through the picture. Must be used with [c_scale](#scale).`ocr_text` - Detect all text elements in an image using the [OCR Text Detection and Extraction add-on](ocr_text_detection_and_extraction_addon) and use the detected bounding box coordinates as the basis of the transformation.`xy_center` - Set the center of gravity to the given `x` & `y` coordinates. |

##### Examples

1. Crop an image to 150x150 while focusing on the largest face in the image (`c_crop,g_face,h_150,w_150`):

  ```

  ```
2. <a id="examples_g_special_position_tile"></a> Crop a [composite image](https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/docs/tiled-birds.jpg), keeping only the largest tile (`c_crop,g_cld-decompose_tile`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_cld-decompose_tile/docs/tiled-birds.jpg
  ```

#### &lt;object&gt;

 `g_<object>`
Requires the [Cloudinary AI Content Analysis add-on](cloudinary_ai_content_analysis_addon).

A [qualifier](#parameter-types) for [cropping](#crop) an image to automatically crop around objects without needing to specify dimensions or an aspect ratio.

> Note
> Object gravity is not supported for [animated images](animated_images). If `g_<object>` is used in an animated image transformation, `center` gravity is applied.

**Use with**: [c_auto](#auto-1) | [c_crop](#crop) | [c_fill](#fill) | [c_lfill](#lfill) | [c_thumb](#thumb)

**Learn more**: [Cloudinary AI Content Analysis add-on](cloudinary_ai_content_analysis_addon)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| object | constant | A specified object or category.  **Possible values**: One or more [supported objects or categories](cloudinary_ai_content_analysis_addon#supported_objects_and_categories), separated by colons (e.g.: `shoe:boot`). |

##### Example

Crop this [large image of a kitchen](https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/docs/kitchen1.jpg) exactly to the coordinates of the detected microwave (`c_crop,g_microwave`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_microwave/docs/kitchen1.jpg
```

#### auto

 `g_auto[:<algorithm>][:<focal gravity>][:<thumb aggressiveness>][:thirds_0]`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) to automatically identify the most interesting regions in the asset, and include in the crop.

> Notes
>
> - Automatic gravity is not supported for [animated images](animated_images). If `g_auto` is used in an animated image transformation, `center` gravity is applied, except when `c_fill_pad` is also specified, in which case an error is returned.
> - Any [custom coordinates](custom_focus_areas#custom_coordinates) defined for a specific image will override the automatic cropping algorithm and only the custom coordinates will be used 'as is' for the gravity, unless you specify 'custom_no_override' or 'none' as the **focal_gravity**.
> - If you're using our [Asia Pacific data center](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't apply `g_auto` to videos.

**Use with**: [c_auto - image only](#auto-1) | [c_auto_pad - image only](#auto_pad) | [c_crop - image only](#crop) | [c_fill](#fill) | [c_fill_pad](#fill_pad) | [c_lfill - image only](#lfill) | [c_thumb - image only](#thumb)

**Learn more**: [Automatic image cropping](image_automatic_gravity) | [Automatic video cropping](video_gravity)

**See also**: [fl_getinfo](#getinfo)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| algorithm | constant | **Image only**. The algorithm to apply: - `subject`: Applies deep-learning algorithms to identify the subjects of an image that are most likely to attract a person's gaze. - `classic`: Uses a combination of saliency heuristics to automatically detect significant regions in the image. |
| focal gravity | constant | Controls which elements are given higher priority for inclusion by the cropping algorithm.   **Images**  This value can be: - One of the focal gravity options as specified for [special positions](#special-position) (e.g.: `face`). - `aoi_<custom coordinates>` - an area of interest specified by custom coordinates of the form `<top left x>_<top left y>_<width>_<height>`. This overrides any custom coordinates already specified for an image (using the [Upload API](image_upload_api_reference) or the [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/console)) (see [Custom coordinates on the fly](custom_focus_areas#custom_coordinates_on_the_fly)). - A specified object or category. You can specify one or more [supported objects or categories](cloudinary_ai_content_analysis_addon#supported_objects_and_categories), separated by colons (e.g.: `shoe:boot`). You can also specify the generic `g_auto:object` value to give priority to any detected object in the image. To use this option, you must be registered to the [Cloudinary AI Content Analysis](cloudinary_ai_content_analysis_addon) add-on.  Appending `_avoid` to the focal gravity minimizes the likelihood of including the specified [object](cloudinary_ai_content_analysis_object_aware_cropping#specifying_objects_to_avoid_using_auto_gravity)/[face](face_detection_based_transformations#position_overlays_avoiding_detected_faces)/[text](ocr_text_detection_and_extraction_addon#avoiding_text) in the crop. **Default:** `faces`.  ---  **Videos**  Possible values:   - `face`: Focuses the crop on the largest face detected in the video. - `faces`: Focuses the crop on all the detected faces in the video. - A specified object or category (see [Adjusting the automatic gravity focal preference for objects](video_gravity#auto_cropping_videos_to_focus_on_a_specified_object)).  **Default**: `null` (gaze prediction algorithm is used). |
| thumb aggressiveness | integer | **Image only**. Relevant only for 'thumb' cropping. The level of aggressiveness of the thumb cropping algorithm between 0 and 100. 100 keeps more of the original image. 0 crops more aggressively and zooms in. |
| thirds_0 | constant | **Image only**. Specify `thirds_0` to disable the [rule of thirds](image_automatic_gravity#the_rule_of_thirds) principle, resulting in the important elements being more centered, rather than offset according to the principle. |

#### clipping_path

 `g_clipping_path_!<clipping path name>!`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) to specify a named clipping path in the image to focus on when cropping an image. Works on file formats that can contain clipping paths such as TIFF.

> Note
> Clipping paths work when the original image is 64 megapixels or less. Above that limit, the clipping paths are ignored.

2. Use the `fill` cropping mode to crop the `cld_sample_clipping_paths` TIFF file focusing on the area of the image containing the clipping path named `vinyl` (`ar_1:2,c_fill,g_clipping_path_!vinyl!`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/ar_1:2,c_fill,g_clipping_path_!vinyl!/docs/cld_sample_clipping_paths.png
  ```
3. Crop the transparent `car_trans` TIFF file around the area of the image containing the clipping path named `front` (`c_crop,g_clipping_path_!front!`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_clipping_path_!front!/docs/cp/car_trans.png
  ```

  > Note
  > This is different than using `fl_clip,pg_name:front`, as the dimensions of the image are cropped to the clipping path, rather than maintaining the size of the original image.

#### region

 `g_region_!<region name>!`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) to specify a named custom region in the image to focus on.

> Notes
>
> - You can set named custom regions using the `regions` parameter of the [upload](image_upload_api_reference#regions_upload), [explicit](image_upload_api_reference#regions_explicit) or [update](admin_api#regions) methods.
> - You can see the coordinates of named regions in images:
>
>
>   - Using the [list delivery type](list_assets#client_side_asset_lists). Apply a tag to the image and use the syntax, `https://res.cloudinary.com/<your_cloud_name>/image/list/<tag>.json`
>   - In the response to a [request for details of a resource](admin_api#get_details_of_a_single_resource_by_public_id), for example:

**Use with**: [c_auto](#auto-1) | [c_crop](#crop) | [c_fill](#fill) | [c_lfill](#lfill) | [c_lpad](#lpad) | [c_mpad](#mpad) | [c_pad](#pad) | [c_thumb](#thumb)

**Learn more**: [Custom regions](custom_focus_areas#custom_regions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| region name | string | **Required.** A named location in the image as specified previously in the `regions` parameter in the [upload method](image_upload_api_reference#regions_upload), the [explicit method](image_upload_api_reference#regions_explicit) or in the [update method](admin_api#regions). Alphanumeric characters and hyphens are permitted. |

##### Example

Create a thumbnail of an image 150 pixels square while focusing on the region defined as `shoes` in a previous upload request (`c_auto,g_region_!shoes!,h_150,w_150`):

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_auto,g_region_!shoes!,h_150,w_150/docs/cr/clothing.jpg
```

#### track_person

 `g_track_person[:obj_<object>][;position_<position>][;adaptivesize_<size>]`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) to add an image or text layer that tracks the position of a person throughout a video. Can be used with fashion object detection to conditionally add the layer based on the presence of a specified object.

> Notes
>
> - Only one tracked layer can be applied at a time.
> - The maximum video duration that tracked layers can be applied to is 3 minutes.
> - When requesting your video on the fly, you will receive a 423 response until the video has been processed. Once processed, subsequent transformations will be applied synchronously.
> - You can apply transformations to the layer, such as controlling duration, by adding those into the layer definition component (e.g. `l_price_tag,du_3`)
> - If you're using our [Asia Pacific or Europe data centers](admin_api#alternative_data_centers_and_endpoints_premium_feature), you currently can't apply `g_track_person` to videos.

**Use with**: [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_fetch](#fetch) | [l_text](#text) | [u_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id-1) | [u_fetch](#fetch-1)

### so (start offset)

 `so_<time value>`
Specifies the first second to include in the video (or audio clip). This parameter is often used in conjunction with the [eo (end offset)](#eo-end-offset) and/or [du (duration)](#du-duration) parameters.

- Can be used independently to **trim** the video (or audio clip) by specifying the first second of the video to include. Everything prior to that second is trimmed off.
- Can be used as a [qualifier](#parameter-types) to control the timing of a corresponding transformation.
- Can be used to indicate the frame of the video to use for generating video thumbnails.

**As a qualifier, use with**: [e_boomerang](#boomerang) | [l_audio](#audio) | [l_&lt;image id&gt;](#image-id) | [l_video](#video)

**Learn more**: [Trimming videos](video_trimming#trimming_videos) | [Adding video overlays](video_layers#video_overlays) | [Adding audio overlays to videos](video_layers#audio_overlays) | [Adding image overlays to videos](video_layers#image_overlays) | [Video thumbnails](video_effects_and_enhancements#video_thumbnails)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time value | number \| string \| constant | **Required.** The offset time from the beginning of the video (or audio clip).  Can be specified as: - A float (in seconds) - A string, representing the time as a percentage of the video, in the format `##p` or `##%`. For example, `25p` represents the frame that is 25% from the beginning of the video. - A constant value of `auto` (relevant only for [video thumbnails](video_effects_and_enhancements#video_thumbnails)). This value automatically selects a frame that best matches the average value of a color distribution analysis of the first few seconds of the video, making it more likely to display a typical frame. |

##### Examples

1. Trim everything before the 10th second from the start of the video (`so_10`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/so_10/blue_sports_car.mp4
  ```
2. Overlay a scaled-down version of the `ski_jump` video over the `blue_sports_car` video, starting from the third second of the blue sports car video--the start offset, and removing the overlay after 6 seconds--the end offset (`l_video:ski_jump/c_scale,w_600/eo_6.0,fl_layer_apply,g_north_east,so_3.0`):

Sets the sampling rate to use when converting videos or animated images to animated GIF or WebP format. If not specified, the resulting GIF or WebP samples the whole video/animated image (up to 400 frames, at up to 10 frames per second). By default, the duration of the resulting animated image is the same as the duration of the input, no matter how many frames are sampled from the original video/animated image (use the [dl (delay)](#dl-delay) parameter to adjust the amount of time between frames).

**Related flag**: [fl_animated](#animated)

**Learn more**: [Converting videos to animated images](videos_to_animated_images)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sampling rate | integer \| string | **Required.** The sampling rate. Can be set as:  - An integer defining the total number of frames to sample from the original asset. The frames are spread out over the length of the video/animated image, e.g. `20` takes one frame every 5%. - A string defining the number of seconds between each frame to sample from the original asset. e.g. `2.3s` takes one frame every 2.3 seconds. |

##### Examples

**See also**: [h (height)](#h-height) | [ar (aspect ratio)](#ar-aspect-ratio) | [Arithmetic expressions](user_defined_variables#arithmetic_expressions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| width value | integer \| float \| constant | **Required.** The width of the asset. Set to: - An **integer** value to set the width to the given number in pixels (e.g., `150` sets the width to exactly 150 pixels). - A **decimal** value to set the width to a multiple of the original dimension (e.g., `0.5` sets the width to half the original width). - `iw` to specify the initial width of the original image. |

##### Examples

1. Resize the image to a width of 100 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio (`c_scale,w_100`):

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_100/face_top.jpg
  ```

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/docs/camera-640.jpg
  ```

#### auto

A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that determines how to automatically resize an image to match the width available for the image in a responsive layout. The parameter can be further customized by overriding the default [rounding step](#w_auto_rounding_step) or by using automatic [breakpoints](#w_auto_breakpoints).

<a id="w_auto_rounding_step"></a>

 `w_auto[:<rounding step>][:<fallback width>]`
The width is rounded up to the nearest rounding step (every 100 pixels by default) in order to avoid creating extra derived images and consuming too many extra transformations. Only works for certain browsers and when Client-Hints are enabled.

**Use with**: [c_limit](#limit)

**Learn more**: [Automatic image width](responsive_server_side_client_hints#automatic_image_width)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rounding step | integer | Sets a new value for the rounding step (e.g.: `50`). **Default**: 100 |
| fallback width | integer | The width to use in the case the actual width cannot be retrieved from the Client-Hints header (e.g.: `500`). **Default**: Not set |

##### Examples

The HTML tag to deliver an image automatically scaled to the maximum width available (`sizes=100vw`) for the image (`c_limit,w_auto`):

You can create the HTML image tag above with our SDKs as follows:

<a id="w_auto_breakpoints"></a>

 `w_auto:breakpoints[_<breakpoint settings>][:<fallback width>][:json]`
The width is rounded up to the nearest breakpoint, where the optimal breakpoints are calculated using either the default breakpoint request settings or using the given settings.

**Use with**: [c_limit](#limit)

**Learn more**: [Responsive breakpoint request settings](image_upload_api_reference#responsive_breakpoints_parameter_request_settings)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| breakpoint settings | string | The breakpoint settings can be overridden by also including new breakpoint values. All 4 of the breakpoint request settings values must be included if you need to override any of them, and must be given in the following order: `_[min_width]_[max_width]_[bytes_step_in_KBs]_[max_images]` (e.g.: `w_auto:breakpoints_200_1920_30_15`). **Defaults**: min_width=50, max_width=1000, bytes_step=20KB, max_images=20. |
| fallback width | integer | The width to use in the case the actual width cannot be retrieved from the Client-Hints header (e.g.: `200`). **Default**: Not set |
| json | keyword | If `json` is specified, it requests that Cloudinary deliver the set of calculated breakpoints as a JSON response instead of delivering the transformed image itself. |

##### Examples

The HTML tag to deliver an image filled to an aspect ratio of 16:9 (`ar_16:9,c_fill`) and then automatically scaled to the closest optimal breakpoint, where the optimal breakpoints are calculated using breakpoint request values of min_width=200, max_width=1920, bytes_step=30, and max_images=15 (`c_limit,w_auto:breakpoints_200_1920_30_15`):

You can create the HTML image tag above with our SDKs as follows:

**See also**: [Arithmetic expressions](user_defined_variables#arithmetic_expressions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| coordinate value | pixels \| float (percentage) | The starting location or offset for custom-coordinates based cropping, overlay placement and certain region related effects. Specify as a number of pixels or as a float value corresponding to a percentage in relation to 1.0.

##### Examples

1. Crop the image using x and y coordinates to define the starting location (`c_crop,h_150,w_150,x_80,y_30`).

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,h_150,w_150,x_80,y_30/face_top.jpg
  ```
2. Position an overlay that is offset horizontally and vertically by 15% from the north east corner(`c_thumb,g_face,h_150,w_150/l_badge/c_scale,w_0.08/fl_layer_apply,g_north_east,x_0.15,y_0.15`).

  ```

### z (zoom)

 `z_<zoom amount>`
A [qualifier](#parameter-types) that controls how close to crop to the detected coordinates when using face-detection, custom-coordinate, or object-specific gravity (when using the [Cloudinary AI Content Analysis addon](cloudinary_ai_content_analysis_addon)).

**Use with**: [c_auto](#auto-1) | [c_crop](#crop) | [c_thumb](#thumb)

> Note
>
> - When used with the `thumb` or `auto` resize modes, the detected coordinates are scaled to completely fill the requested dimensions and then cropped as needed.
> - When used with the `crop` resize mode, the zoom qualifier has an impact only if resize dimensions (height and/or width) are **not** specified. In this case, the crop dimensions are determined by the detected coordinates and then adjusted based on the requested zoom.

**Learn more**: [Creating image thumbnails](image_crop_modes#thumb)

**See also**: [Arithmetic expressions](user_defined_variables#arithmetic_expressions)

##### Syntax details

| Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| zoom amount | float (percentage) | The amount of zoom to apply when cropping around the detected coordinates of faces, objects or custom regions.  Specify as a float value corresponding to a percentage, where 1.0 instructs to crop to the detected coordinates. Values less than one will result in a crop outside the coordinates (zoom out) and values greater than one will crop closer than the coordinates (zoom in). For example `0.8` represents a zoom amount of 80%.  **Default**: `1.0`. |

##### Examples

1. Generate a 150*150 square thumbnail image using face detection with a zoom amount of 75% (`c_thumb,g_face,h_150,w_150,z_0.75`).

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_face,z_1.2/woman_sample.jpg
  ```
3. Crop the image around the sink, but zoom out to 80% before cropping (`c_crop,g_sink,z_0.8`).

  ```
  https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_crop,g_sink,z_0.8/docs/kitchen1.jpg
  ```
