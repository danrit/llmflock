## Context

Cloudinary is a SaaS company providing cloud media management services, specifically it includes an image transformation service. The service allows to transform images using a url-based API. The reference documentation of the service is given below.

Cloudflare is a company providing content delivery network services, specifically it includes an image transformation service. The service allows to transform images using a url-based API. The reference documentation of the service is given below.

The syntax of the transformation url is different between the two services. It is provided further down in the sections "Cloudinary Syntax" and "Cloudflare Syntax".

## Instruction

**Cloudinary URL structure**:

The Cloudinary full delivery URL structure is: `https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud_name>/<asset_type>/<delivery_type>/<transformations>/<version>/<public_id>.<extension>
cloudflare: https://<ZONE>/cdn-cgi/image/<OPTIONS>/<SOURCE-IMAGE>`

In that structure, the `<transformations>` component is the one that needs to be converted. The other components are not relevant for the conversion.

**Cloudflare URL structure**:

The Cloudflare full delivery URL structure (for a remote image, like in this context) is: `https://<ZONE>/cdn-cgi/image/<OPTIONS>/<SOURCE-IMAGE>`

In that structure, the `<OPTIONS>` component is the one that needs to be generated. The other components are not relevant for the conversion.

 **The goal is to convert the cloudinary transformation url to a cloudflare transformation url**.
 
The input is the Cloudinary transformation component `cloudinary_url_component={cloudinary_url_component}` the output is the equivalent transformation component of a cloudflare url `cloudflare_url_component`.


Example of Transformation component in Cloudinary and equivalent in Cloudflare:

|           | Cloudinary                             | Cloudflare                                 |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Example 1 | `c_thumb,g_north_west,h_320,w_320,z_1` | `fit=crop,gravity=0.0x0.0,h=320,w=320`     |
| Example 2 | `b_rgb:3448C5,c_pad,h_320,w_320`       | `background=%233448C5,fit=pad,h=320,w=320` |
| Example 3 | `q_auto:eco/f_avif/e_saturation:-100`  | `q=medium-low,f=avif,saturation=0`         |


For example 1 the full delivery urls are:
- Cloudinary: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dtl8ufrfi/image/upload/c_thumb,g_north_west,h_320,w_320,z_1/9.-Saghmosavank-church-in-winter-Haykhove-CCBYSA4.jpg` 
- Cloudflare: `https://info2007.xyz/cdn-cgi/image/fit=crop,gravity=0.0x0.0,h=320,w=320/images/9.-Saghmosavank-church-in-winter-Haykhove-CCBYSA4.jpg`

If a transformation component in Cloudinary does not have an equivalent in Cloudflare, return "null" for the output.

**Expected output syntax**

Format the data in the response as a JSON Markdown fenced code block: 1 Object with 1 attribute `cloudflare_url_component`.

Example output:

```json
{{
  "cloudflare_url_component": "fit=crop,gravity=0.0x0.0,h=320,w=320"
}}
```
